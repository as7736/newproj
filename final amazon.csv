However, the real problem arose when I took it on the road with the window down. The headset completely lost signal or people would say it sounded like I was underwater.I believe it wouldn't be a great choice for truckers, as it may not provide the best performance in that environment. For normal use, particularly in an office setting, it should be just fine. The size of the headset is somewhat large, which I personally like. It also has the ability to expand to fit your head size.

"Stahlwille 96410704 Double Ended Ring Wrench Set Corona, 6mm x 7mm to 20mm x 22mm, Shallow Offset, Chrome Alloy Steel, Chrome Plated, No.23/8, 8 pcs",Stahlwille,"Stahwhile 96410704 Double-ended Ring Wrench Set CORONA with Shallow Offset Heads are made of chrome alloy steel, drop forged, hardened and tempered to provide high torque and added leverage, and polished with chrome finish for protection against rust and corrosion and offers high hardness. This professional wrench set has thin-walled rings and 10-degree shallow ring end offset which facilitate work in confined or tight spaces, perfect hand tool for automotive repair and maintenance, machinery, etc. In addition, the rings are higher than standard nuts - which prevents the spanner seizing on the nut. It also has Anti-Slip Drive (AS Drive) profile which enables high force transmission without damaging the fasteners. While the force acts on the flats of the screws, the corners are left free and are not rounded off. This wrench set is packed in a carton. It includes 6mm x 7mm, 8mm x 9mm, 10mm x 11mm, 12mm x 13mm, 14mm x 15mm, 16mm x 17mm, 18mm x 19mm, and 20mm x 22mm double ended ring wrenches. Made of course in Germany and manufactured under the most stringent quality control conditions and adheres to DIN 897/ISO 10104 specifications. There are many wrenches available. But hardly any that are as well thought out as Stahlwille wrenches. The non-slip finish means all our wrenches fit comfortably in the hand, even when used for long periods of time and when higher forces are applied. By combining high-quality special steels, which are subject to continuous quality controls, with a sophisticated forging process, we make them particularly durable and robust. The thumb groove along the wrench handle eliminates material where there is no stress and concentrates it where it is needed. Similar to the principle of an H-beam in construction, extreme load bearing capacity and maximum flexural strength are achieved with lower weight. As one of only a few manufacturers, Stahlwille offers a comprehensively diverse range of metric, imperial, spline drive and TORX wrenches. Stahlwille's tight manufacturing tolerances and reproducible dimensional accuracy ensure that one Stahlwille wrench is as close-fitting as the next. In this way, both open-jaw and ring wrenches will always firmly hug the fastener head for excellent power-lock.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Power & Hand Tools"",""Hand Tools"",""Wrenches"",""Socket Wrenches""]",Stahlwille,,Hardness and strange of the wrench,"[""SET OF 8 WRENCHES.

"DANIEL SMITH Extra Fine Watercolor Paint, 15ml Tube, Iridescent Antique Copper, 284640009",DANIEL SMITH,"DANIEL SMITH Extra Fine Watercolors - classic watercolors of unsurpassed purity and permanence. The vision in the formulation of DANIEL SMITH watercolors was twofold​; First and foremost, to produce watercolors that are the best in lightfastness and permanence.Second, to offer a selection of truly unique colors. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are formulated to meet and exceed the highest industry standards​ for the manufacture of artist’s paints, and every batch made is tested and analyzed for its performance qualities. DANIEL SMITH is truly the worldwide leader of watercolors for artists with 240+ beautiful colors in the 15ml watercolors, the most of any manufacturer​. Many are traditional colors relied upon by all artists, and there are many “truly unique” colors made only by DANIEL SMITH that have become so important to watercolor artists. PrimaTek Watercolors are made from minerals, often semi precious minerals, that have been ground into pigments, mixed with gum arabic (the binder) and milled into PrimaTek Watercolors​. The first was Lapis Lazuli Genuine in 1998, since then, many more have been added such as Amethyst Genuine, Piemontite Genuine and Serpentine Genuine. Most of these colors have wonderful granulating effects that some artists have called “magical”. Luminescent Watercolors have special optical effects perfect for subjects that have a sparkle, sheen, or reflective glow​ like the iridescence of hummingbird feathers or the sheen of metals. Cadmium Hues, DANIEL SMITH has developed safe and vibrant Cadmium Hues with the density and richness of cadmium colors without the cadmium pigment​. Virtually identical in color to their namesakes, they are cleaner in mixtures and much stronger in tints. The working properties – staining power, semi-transparency and excellent lightfastness – are nearly identical to those of the low-soluble cadmium colors DANIEL SMITH previously manufactured. Some unique colors are created exclusively by DANIEL SMITH​ like Cascade Green, Green Gold and Moonglow. DANIEL SMITH also finds unusual pigments to make colors like Mayan Red, Lunar Blue and Enviro-Friendly Red Iron Oxide to provide more choices for artists. Other colors are from pigments DANIEL SMITH has sourced, often from very specific locations, colors like Burgundy Yellow Ochre, Monte Amiata Natural Sienna and Roasted French Ochre. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are a favorite of artists all over the world​, from professional artists to the beginning watercolorists because of the beautiful colors, consistent performance and lasting color or lightfastness. DANIEL SMITH Watercolors are packed with high quality pigments using pure gum arabic as the binder – no fillers.​ For each color, DANIEL SMITH selects the perfect grind to yield particle sizes that maximize the qualities inherent in the pigment, balancing maximum pigment load with minimum vehicle content. DANIEL SMITH offers many ways to experience their Watercolors as well as providing extra creative means for artists with their Watercolor Grounds, Masking Fluid and Walnut Ink. 15ml Watercolors​, available in more than 240 colors, the most of any manufacturer.5ml Watercolors​, available in 88 of the most popular colors DANIEL SMITH makes.Watercolor Sticks​, 51 popular DANIEL SMITH Watercolors shaped into stick form to draw and paint with, a new way to expressively use watercolors.Watercolor Dot Cards, ​a great way to try DANIEL SMITH Watercolors without buying whole tubes of paint. These are dots of pure DANIEL SMITH Watercolors that reactivate into paint with the touch of a wet brush, allowing artists to easily and cost effectively, try many colors. Two sizes: 238 Dot Card to try nearly the entire line of DANIEL SMITH Watercolors and the 66 Dot Card to try many DANIEL SMITH Watercolors.PrimaTek Watercolors, ​37 PrimaTek Watercolors, made from minerals, many semi-precious, that are ground into pigments and made into unique watercolors. Luminescent Watercolors, ​48 Luminescent Watercolors with optical effects.Watercolor Sets​: Essentials Set, PrimaTek Set, Alvaro Castagnet’s Master Set, Primary and Secondary Sets.Watercolor Ground​, Paint watercolors on any surface when prepared with DANIEL SMITH Watercolor Ground, available in 4 colors; Titanium White, Buff Titanium, Mars Black and Transparent. Watercolor Ground can help “rescue” a watercolor painting when applied over a mistake, giving an artist a second chance with a new surface to paint on.

My whole life, it's always been this way, due to a defect with my adrenals. It's a very rare condition, that I won't get into here. But I have to say, I've tried the lotions, cohosh, soy, and so on. Some of them helped with the various issues I have due to the low estrogen, but nothing really rocked my world. BUT! I'm loving this product so far, beyond anything I've ever tried. The only thing about it that could remotely be viewed as negative is that I feel much more sensitive emotionally. This past week, I have been crying almost every day. It's not in a bad way, though! I'm crying because puppies are cute, because someone was kind, because I love my boyfriend so much! I don't look at it as a drawback, I just look at it as making me feel more ""girly"". Like all but one of my little crying jags was happy tears. And after a week and a half, I'm probably up at least a half a cup size. I put on my sports bra today, which normally has a flat surface between my two breasts. This time, there was a noticeable dip between them, very pronounced and not subtle at all. I think that's pretty unusual, to fill out so quickly, but again, I'm a woman genetically and by birth and just have a slight dysfunction with the organ that makes hormones. So I'm not battling uphill against testosterone as some of the other users of this product may be, just filling a gap. (I'm not trying to be insensitive, I'm just trying to say this is a great supplement, but you probably shouldn't expect noticable boob growth unless you are in my exact situation. It will probably take most mtf trans more time to notice a difference, as other reviewers have noted.) Anyway, I've also noticed that pretty much all of my female body parts are getting a bit more sensitive, and my sex drive is up. That's all I can say without being lewd, but maybe you've seen the cartoon Archer? (Look it up, it's for adults, and it's a very funny spy parody.) There's a line from the show that's just, ""SPLOOSH"". It is said by the female characters on the show when they find someone attractive. If you're reading this review, you're probably an adult, and you can probably figure out what I'm getting at. Honestly, if it were up to me, I wouldn't be cute about it at all. I'm just making sure my review here is approved by Amazon. Meh.Long story short? I haven't had anything this good, aside from ACTUAL HRT. I wish I'd known about this years ago.PS- Oh! Wait! I did break out a little at first, but it passed. Got a few pimples in the first few days, but it was very mild, in all the little annoying places I got them when I went through puberty (with the assistance of pills), and then haven't had any new ones. YMMV.Great value for the productThis pill works. My husband did some research on ""resetting my hormones"" because im dependant on birth control so i can get a menstrual cycle. I was having too many symptoms of unbalanced hormones.. thinning hair, mood swings, tired all the time, not so pretty skin... ect. I always go for home remedies and this with another pill have worked for me! And YES YOUR BREAST WILL GROW. i was a true 36D and i would also fit into sister size 34DD now i have plenty of spillage and the 34DD aren't really an option.I have noticed this pill has curved my apetite and i have also gained on the scale like 2- 3pounds since ive been on it (about 5 weeks). No big deal though.Totally recommend if you're using it for hormonal issues or if you are looking for breast enhancements.I have taken NOW product Multi-gland caps for men for more than 5 years. They no longer manufacture it but have made a number of individual products (for liver or pancreas or kidney, etc.). I am almost done with my first bottle and things have been going well so far. I have a lot of problems with some products making me sick but so far the transition has been smooth and easy.I am a woman taking these for extremely low testosterone levels (level was basically zero). I feel much better since I started taking this along with Raw Female (for low estrogen) and chaste tree (for low progesterone). My muscles are growing larger and firmer, my sex drive has improved, skin tone is better along with my confidence and energy level.So far this has been a good product for me. I have paired it with esto8pn and it works well together. I haven't noticed any side effects while taking this and most products tend to have something that I react to. Overall good product and company.Pros: good sized product Easy to swallow Soft capsules No side effects noticed No strong tastes/after tasteCons: So far noneEn mi opinión solo 4 estrellas porque pensé que eran soft gels pero son cápsulas en lo personal me gustan las soft gels.I make my own cat food & need multi-gland for supplement. The capsules come apart easily & it dissolves well in liquid. As I don't have a lab to know if the info on the bottle is correct, this is all I can judge by.

I've been spurned before. Overall I'm pretty happy with it, though.I've been PC gaming since middle school, but I broke my right arm when I was in high school. I can use a mouse in my right hand fine for day to day stuff but between the scar tissue and slight nerve pinching that causes it to be uncomfortable, really uncomfortable for gaming. For whatever reason using a keyboard in my right is fine though (I guess because my hand rests on it differently).I've spent YEARS, actually over a decade, looking for an ideal gamepad. I ended up with a Logitech G13 at some point and have stuck with it but I don't like it for MMO's, basically not enough buttons combined with having to program different profiles for each game was rough. I picked up something really similar to this device a couple years ago but it was angled a bit differently and used Cherry MX Black switches and it actually physically hurt my arm after brief play sessions (20-30 minutes). Hence why I was worried about this.After pulling all the keycaps off and spinning them 90 degrees so I can use it vertically instead of horizontally and programming it... it's taking a bit of getting used to a slightly altered button layout but I'm getting there. It's not as comfortable as my Logitech G13 but I figured it wouldn't be, but it's WAY more comfortable than the similar product I tried a couple years ago.The software's easy enough to use, although I'd love a toggle to switch from horizontal to vertical (not necessary, just a nice option for those of us doing that), and once I got it setup I haven't had to run it again.I could see this being a great macro keyboard for work use, but for me it's a ""better than good enough but not perfect"" gaming pad. I'm still tempted to start researching custom building my own so it could be more ergonomic but for now this will work.Update (08/05/2018):Figured I'd do a ""I've had this almost a year now"" update. It's still a solid 4 stars. Still vaguely interested in custom building something more ergonomic but haven't felt the need to since I got used to this. Not perfectly comfortable for my needs but I'm used to it and it's working just fine. Now the biggest complaint I have is that the manufacturer still hasn't listed this on their actual website and from I can tell the only response to ""where can I download the programming software"" is ""the URL is on the manual."" Neither is a huge deal, but I tossed the manual a while back and I'm curious if the software's been updated at all and can't track down any website to download it.Update 10/18/2020:I bought another one. Old one's mostly fine, keycaps are dirty but I could clean them if i cared enough. I was able to put my old one back into ""programming mode"" to copy the keymapping to a file, then load that file onto the new one, and I didn't realize how nice that would be.They did change the model a bit. The shell feels cheaper, it's lighter, the USB cable ports don't come with covers, the gold/bronze colored screw caps on the top now are just formed bits of plastic in the shell... It's fine, but definitely doesn't feel or look as premium even though it costs the same. It did come with a pretty basic set of black and white key labels you can use and a keycap remover (which I don't think was included last time). These labels are just the main keys, no F1-F12 row or other such ""uncommon"" keys. A-Z, 1 to 0, and some punctuation keys. I don't think the cost of these add-ins outweighs the cost reduction of the cheaper materials/build quality. Again, it's fine, but for how much it costs I could get a similar quality 104+ full size keyboard. Granted, they probably have a special PCB, and a different kind of chipset so it's fully programmable, but those kinds of thing shouldn't fluctuate the cost so severely.Another change is that the older model is flat, no angle, but this model has a very slight angle to the body. If used as pictured it's like a normal keyboard slant, but used vertical by my right hand like I do it leans the right up into my hand... which is kind of fine? It's a weak enough angle that it's not super noticeable and it probably helps shorten the distance my pinkie finger is reaching, so I guess that's fine.Still a solid 4 stars from me, but the obvious cost reductions done without reducing the price are tempting me to drop the score. There's nothing else quite like it for my needs, at least not without spending WAY more, so I'm just happy someone's making stuff like this.I got this product to increase my workflow speed with Design programs such as Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign, and After Effects.Before this product, I had already been used to all of my regular hotkeys & hand positions for the various programs, but I was worried that at some point I was going to obtain wrist issues with all the 'Alt', 'Ctrl', and 'Shift' key combinations on a daily basis- most especially now that I've began working from home.Once I got this product, I quickly realized just how much time I'll have to put into programming this to get back into my traditional workflow.After some time, I figured out my resting hand position, my most common keys, the best placement for the keys, and setup all of the hotkeys I use regularly.At the beginning, I felt like a newborn attempting to walk being 100% honest. I literally wanted to return the thing and go back to using my keyboard, but I was determined to use it because of the potential for it to be even better than a traditional keyboard.The most difficult part was remembering where all of the keys were, without having to shutdown the Keypad, re-open the editor in programming mode, and taking a screenshot of all the currently set keys.This keypad did however come with 2 color sets of Keycap stickers for a traditional QWERTY keyboard, black and white. As I started to place my stickers onto the keycaps however, I quickly realized that it'd literally be zero use if I'm going to have different key programmings for different Profile setups.To explain: If I place an A sticker on key 27, then in Profile 1 it's fine. But for Profiles 2-3, I'll either have to have key 27 be the same A key to not get mixed up with the stickers, or not use the sticker at all in the case that I prefer key 27 to instead be a combination of Ctrl+Shift+FSo I ended up taking off all the stickers I had put on, and the ones that were left on ended up coming off on their own within 2 weeks. Mostly due to the heat from my fingers resting on them, likely causing the sticky part of the sticker to melt and dry up when it's pops off.I ended up switching out most of the white keycaps to my resting hand area so that I could use Sharpie to write in letters, key combos, or symbols to dictate the tool it's for.Which was half a mistake, as the sharpie would rub off even after a day of drying.This issue is literally the only reason why I'm docking off a star from the overall rating, if there was a more convenient way to visualize the current key presets on screen per profile, then I think it would be an insane addition to this products functionality.This product has literally become like my big toe (For humans, if you lose your big toes, you'll have to relearn how to walk)I don't use any of my design programs without my hand on this keypad, and my workflow has increased insanely to the point where I can very quickly get carried away with myself and do MUCH MORE work than I'm supposed to. I highly suggest this to anyone who uses programs that regularly uses 2-3 Key combo hotkeys. It's been the most convenient purchase I've made for my business so far, and I've actually been extremely tempted to buy a second one just so that I could imitate an entire keyboard layout with 2 pads and be like a hackerman in a 2077 movie.Actually bought this a while back. Now that I retired I finally had a chance to use it.Downloaded the software, simple enough to set up. No issues getting it programmed.Has a good feel to it.Being a) left handed, and b) a bit older, I found this unit great for game playing.I play some of the older titles... Black Mesa/Half Life series, etc...This lets me have everything I need right at my (right) fingertips without having to do any reaching.I am pleased with the quality and sturdiness. Programming is easy and works well. My only wish is that it came with a set of lettering stencils to label the keycaps. I bought a black and a white fine point Sharpie to hand write text directly on the keycaps.The unit is well made but it has functional limitations. Number of macros is very limited and the unit cannot be programmed on the fly. You have to put it in special mode and disconnect and reconnect every time a change is required. My requirement during programming is that I can store commonly used variable and other text which will change frequently. I ended up returning this unit and used my existing Logitech programmable keyboard with AutoHotKey freeware.My experience mirrors that of other reviewers who have complained that key combos on this do not work reliably and you cannot program the keypad to send right-shift / alt / ctrl plus a keystroke.If you just want it to send function keys, or regular alpha characters it seems to work just fine.But shift + something simply does not work.I absolutely love this thing, it has mad emy workflow as a digital artist much more fluid and ergonomic! The mechanical keys are nice and clicky, and the smaller for factor allows me to use this alongside my tablet.My only complaints aren't very major: firstly, this uses an outdated mini usb cable, not even micro usb let alone usb C, which not optimal at all and makes replacement more difficult; secondly, the makers don't supply stickers for function keys like Enter, Alt, Ctrl, Backspace, etc. which are all used in various editing/creating software, so prepare to create your own labels. Thirdly, and this is my only MAJOR complaint: you can only program the keys on a WINDOWS machine. The keypad is usable on MacOS, but to program the keys to your liking, you better have a Windows machine somewhere, otherwise you are stuck.Love this keypad, perfect size and customizations for day trading. I use a lot of hotkeys in the platform I trade with and set it all up for use on this keypad. Keys are very accurate and responsive.Absolutely fantastic product. I have 2 of them right now and more on the way. I use 1 for gaming, I have it mapped to adapt to most common control schemes. I use another for content creation.My only gripe is the dated software used to program it. It works perfectly reliably though so no issues on my end.","[""【48 Programmable Keys & 8 Macro Keys Based Hardware】Program all 48 keys and create 8 complex macros with the configuration software to take full command of your computer.

La pantalla de gran calidad. Ajuste perfecto al marco y con los tornillos. Buen contraste, brillo y sensibilidad.Traen una  plantilla para colocar los tornillos. Muy útil, evita equivocarte en su posición. Te recomiendo que la uses sí o sí. Evitará que metas la pata.Incluye un juego completo de herramientas para hacer el trabajo. Los destornilladores pueden ser mejores, pues la punta no es lo suficientemente  fina para los tornillos tan pequeños. Pero las herramientas en general cumplen su función.Debes tener buena vista e iluminación para hacer este trabajo, si pasas de los 40 años como yo, consigue unos buenos lentes, pues los tornillos son muy pequeños. Mira la foto de un tornillos sobre mi uña para que compares el tamaño de los tornillos. Primero debes quitar los 2 tornillos que sujetan la pantalla, cerca del puerto de carga, luego otros 4 toenillod en el chasis, que protejen los conectores de los flex y 3 en la parte posterior de la pantalla, para poder liberar la cámara y face id.Necesitan un secadora de pelo que tire aire caliente para ensuavisar la goma que sujeta la pantalla y jalando con la ventosa de succión suministrada se forma un pequeño espacio por donde metes la uña o púa plástica para con paciencia ir despegando la pantalla. Ten cuidado de no cortarte si la pantalla está quebrada. El proceso es fácil y se te van 30 minutos. No corras, para que no dañes nada por dentro.Incluye la goma o sello contra agua. Viene en un plástico que sirve de guía. Muy fácil de poner. Sólo hazlo antes de colocar los flex, para más fácil. Asegúrate de limpiar bien el marco del chasis antes de colocar el sello. Yo lo hice utilizando el destornillador plano incluido.Wow. Incluye el vidrio temperado, que  completa el kit de excelente forma.Por mejorar:Las instrucciones están bien, pero las fotografías para alguien sin experiencia son pequeñas y carecen de detalles. Recomiendo complementar mirando un par de videos.Tiempo de la reparación:Duré como 1 hora haciendo el trabajo. Supongo que haciendo esto unas 10 veces, podría durar 20 minutos. Si no tienes experiencia, saca un rato tranquilo para hacer el trabajo. Sin niños que te pierdan los tornillos y acompañado de un buen café.Recomendación:Sumo cuidado con los flex, al retirar la pantalla mala, son delicados y si dañas algo,  luego el celular no funcionará bien. Hay posibilidad de dañar el face id. Así que con cuidado y amor todo saldrá bien. Si quiebras la pantalla mala al sacarla, no importa, deporsí ya está mala. Pero NO dañes los flex. Por cierto, también debes aplicar algo de calor para quitar con más facilidad parte del flex del face id y una pieza plástica que separa los sensores. Hazlo con calma. Mejor durar 10 minutos más que ir a dañar la pieza.Para terminar me encontré una sorpresa dentro del kit. Venía incluida una promoción llamada ""scratch to win"" consiste en una tarjeta que la raspas y puedes ganarte un premio. Yo me gané uno, genial. Solo le escribes al vendedor y listo.Los felicito por el producto.Ah y mi celular estrenando pantalla quedó muy bien",null

I personally think they run big. While in theory I'm a true 7 (like 20 yrs ago), in actuality I can't remember the last time I was able to squeeze my feet comfortably in anything but an 8 (except for Birkenstocks) after two babies back to back followed by a year of high dose steroids. I ordered these in a 7 1/2 because I sized down a whole size to my ""true size"" before in Uggs at review suggestion and they never really stretched out enough for true comfort. This was likely a mistake. They fit in the width though by no means tightly but are a bit long and after three hours of wear had considerably loosened all over. I really should of purchased a 7 at least so they would be fitted like a sock as they are meant to because I'm sure these are going to be way too big way too quickly but when they are I'll use them for around the house and get a new pair for outdoors.That being said, I'm not sending them back because I don't want to spend another day of my life without these shoes. I purchased the black and its a true, deep matte black and the fringe is neutral and lays perfectly flat. I also got them in the suede sole and I'm glad I did, I used to have a pair of suede sole mocs when I lived in Seattle and even walking at least ten miles a day mostly on concrete in that weather which isn't optimal conditions for these types of shoes (I didn't drive during those years) the mocs lasted three years before finally developing a hole. In more normal climates and usage these could easily last ten yrs (live in Texas and drive now lol). Don't believe people who say these can't be worn out of doors, they simply have to be seasoned properly by getting them wet and wearing on dirt and grass till the get slick and hard.The seude on these is perfect. No its not the nearly nubuck softness of some higher end seude shoes I have but its not the rough cheapie suede either and in reality you wouldn't want a shoe like this to be any softer. Don't get me wrong, they ARE soft but they are thicker and sturdier than some suede which is just right. One thing I didn't realize is that these booties have like some kind of memory foam insert which my old mocs didn't and this makes them even more comfy. Like wearing suede socks with some cushioning, I think if I added a little arch support stick on insert it would be like going bare foot with arch support and foot protection. The zipper seems to work well but I could see where it could slide down. I would say these may work better on people with a more delicate foot and smaller ankle because I have bird bones and it looks like if I had a normal sized to large sized ankle then they might be fitted and look odd. They have enough room around my ankle and fit around my foot so well that they look ultra flattering. Also thanks to the simplicity and matte black of the shoes they also look more hip and less boho. So far I've only worn these with a pair of slim fit, vintage boyfriend ankle jeans and they work perfectly. Adorable perfection. I almost exclusively wear ankle length jeans due to my proportions and that's actually what I wanted a flat ankle boot for and these look super cool. However I think these will also look really good with summer dresses and even leggings and tunics this winter.I honestly didn't think I would like this, both fit and style but haven't been able to find an ankle boot that worked for me so I decided to give these a quick try. I'm so in love. They're surprisingly comfy tho I will add an insert. I do have pretty nasty arthritis in my feet so I'm a bit particular about my shoes but these make me feel like I can leap about like an elf. And my feet kinda look Elvin too. I can't think of enough good things to say about these booties. No, they may not be for everyone especially if you have a wider foot or ankle and if you prefer true orthotics but otherwise these are amazing. I've owned hundreds of shoes, many costing hundreds of dollars and these are surprisingly enough the absolute favorite shoes ever. They have everything I could ever want in a shoe. Even my mom, who rolled her eyes when I said I ordered this, flipped out when I put them on and even more when she tried them on. She hates completely flat shoes and has truly disformed arthritic feet and she ordered a pair an hr after I received mine. Plus she hates these kind of styles but thought these looked surprisingly hip and sophisticated for a moc bootie.So...another convert. If you think these may work for you please give these a try but read up on seasoning the sole and they'll last a good while depending on your usage and weather conditions. Now I'm ordering some in other colors and I really, really wish minnetonka would bring these back in pebble leather and not just as the occasional overpriced promo product because seriously, how much more versatile!!!Edit: while these are still my favorite shoes ever the tab on the back crumbled the second time I wore them making it difficult for my arthritic fingers to close the back. I am going to contact the sender and hope they are able to send me a replacement tab but its disappointing quality for that to happen the second time I out them on and makes me sure the other side will do the same. I will still purchase more because I love the style and comfort but they need to put better quality pulls on the back.","[""100% Cow Suede Leather"",""Imported"",""Rubber sole"",""Soft, supple suede"",""Padded cushion insole"",""Thin rubber sole""]"

Roof and Gutter Deicing Cable - 80' Black Electric Heating Cord with 3 Prong Plug & 120 Volt Operation - 14081,Wrap-On,"This pre-assembled cable has been designed for the sole purpose of preventing the formation of ice dams on pitched roofs with non-combustible tab shingles and in metal or plastic gutters and downspouts. It provides drainage channels so that as natural thawing occurs, water has a path to flow off the roof and through the gutters and downspouts. This cable is not for use on a flat roof nor is it intended to clear the roof of snow and ice. The installation of this product is simple and it can be used with either metal or plastic gutters. Read and follow all instructions and pay particular attention to the following points: Install the cable when the outside temperature is above 50˚F because at lower temperatures shingle material may be brittle; Clear all leaves, pine needles and debris from the roof, gutters and downspouts before operating the cable. Do not plug the cable in unless it has been completely uncoiled or it will be damaged. Each package contains one ready-to-install cable, shingle clips, cable spacers and complete installation instructions.

The materials used feel durable and capable of withstanding everyday wear and tear. The case snugly fits my iPad Pro, ensuring a secure and precise fit. I appreciate the reinforced corners, which provide added shock absorption and protect the device against accidental drops.The design of the case is minimalist and elegant.

It also doesn't interfere with any of the device's functionalities, including the buttons, ports, and cameras.

This allows me to comfortably watch videos, browse the internet, or work on my iPad Pro without straining my neck. The stand is sturdy and holds the tablet securely in both landscape and portrait orientations.However, one aspect that could be improved is the closure mechanism. The case utilizes a magnetic closure, which isn't as secure as a strap or a snap closure. While it generally keeps the case closed, it can sometimes come undone if not properly aligned or with rough handling. A more secure closure system would provide additional peace of mind when carrying the iPad Pro in a bag or during travel.Overall, the Case for iPad Pro 10.5-Inch offers reliable protection and a stylish design.

Seresto Large Dog Vet-Recommended Flea & Tick Treatment & Prevention Collar for Dogs Over 18 lbs. | 2-Pack,Seresto,"Give your dog long-lasting protection against fleas and ticks with a Seresto Large Dog flea and tick collar. Unlike other flea and tick protection, Seresto Large Dog flea and tick collars kill and repel fleas and ticks for eight continuous months. Seresto Large Dog flea and tick collars are recommended by veterinarians, stocked by 8,000 vet clinics* and have been trusted* by pet owners for nearly a decade.Seresto Large Dog collars make your dog’s comfort a priority by killing fleas and ticks on contact, so pests don’t have to bite your dog to die. Existing fleas die within 24 hours after initial application of the collar. After 24 hours, any new fleas on the dog are killed within 2 hours with protection against further flea infestation lasting 8 months. The prevention of infestations with new ticks starts at 48 hours after application of the collar. 48 hours after application, any new ticks are repelled and/or killed in as quickly as 6 hours. Seresto Large Dog collars protect against common pests like deer ticks, American dog ticks, brown dog ticks, and Lone Star ticks; they’re also effective against chewing lice. Fleas and ticks not only cause discomfort; fleas can transmit bartonellosis or tapeworm. Ticks can transmit Borrelia burgdorferi which causes Lyme Disease. Check the product label for information on potential side effects.Seresto Large Dog flea and tick collars are for dogs at least 7 weeks old, and there’s no prescription needed. They’re odorless, non-greasy and water resistant to swimming, exposure to rain or sunlight, bathing, and shampoo treatment.**Seresto is a trademark of Elanco or its affiliates.*Elanco Animal Health, data on file **Seresto Large Dog is water resistant and remains effective following a shampoo treatment, swimming or after exposure to rain or sunlight. Under normal conditions, effectiveness lasts for 8 months. In order to maintain an eight-month duration, dogs must not be bathed more than once per month. For dogs that swim once a month or more, the control duration is reduced to 5 months for flea control and reduced to 7 months for tick control.Seresto is rigorously regulated worldwide with your pet in mind. Fake Seresto collars are ineffective and can put your furry friend at risk for expensive flea and tick infestations and painful flea and tick bites which can result in transmission of certain diseases.

We keep one in our laundry room, kitchen, and the garage. You will save money and the towel is reasonably absorbent. Regardless, we went through a lot of paper towel and it was expensive, especially when our grandchildren visited! Another nice aspect is that when you pull a towel out you have to make an effort to waste the product because the towels tear at perforation. Normal rolled paper towel is the opposite, you pull on the roll and end up tearing off 5,6 sheets or more. That’s a waste and adds up.

The Definitive Vince Guaraldi,Fantasy,"Fantasy Records salutes the famed pianist, who, despite gold records and global acclaim as a renowned jazz artist, will always be best known for his cheerful, uplifting work with Charlie Brown and the Peanuts gang. Although he passed away at the young age of 47 in 1976, Vince Guaraldi will always live on in the minds and hearts of jazz and music fans of all ages; and this special 2-CD set is the ideal salute to this very deserving artist.","[""CDs & Vinyl"",""Jazz"",""Cool Jazz""]",Fantasy,,"If there is a more iconic album cover in all of American West Coast jazz history, I have yet to come across it. A nattily dressed man in dark suit, thick rimmed eyeglasses, and an enormous handlebar mustache casually rests one foot on a children’s piano while a beautifully coiffed blond boy in a black and red striped tee shirt, shorts, and potato shaped brown leather shoes looks curiously at the white keys from a short distance away. The boy, of course, is Schroeder from Charles Schulz’s beloved “Peanuts” comics, and the mustachioed man in the dark glasses and suit is – who else? – San Francisco’s own jazz piano master, Mr. Vince Guaraldi.Inside, there are not one but two wonderful long playing CDs filled with Vince’s classic compositions and jazz interpretations recorded between 1955 and 1966, all beautifully mastered by Joe Tarantino in Berkeley and released in 2009 by Fantasy Records as a “definitive” anthology. A revealing, well written essay on Vince’s life and musical legacy is provided by jazz journalist, Doug Ramsey, and the liner notes include essential details on the original recordings and the many talented musicians who accompanied Vince over the years, like guitarists Eddie Duran and Bola Sete, bass players Dean O’Reilly and Fred Marshall, and drummers Colin Bailey, John Markham, and Jerry Granelli.The Definitive Vince Guaraldi gets played more often, all year long, on my home stereo than any album in my jazz, rock, folk, or classical music collections. Maybe it’s because I acquired most of Vince’s music shortly after moving to the Bay Area, or because I feel a special connection to his familiar haunts in the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco and in Menlo Park, where he passed away following a heart attack in 1976, while taking a breather between gigs at a local club - a music man to the very end. Maybe because the 2-disc compilation works so perfectly well with mealtimes in the afternoon and evening, with California cuisine and local wines. Disc 1 contains some of Vince’s best original works, like “Cast Your Fate to the Wind” and “A Star Song.” Disc 2 has all the Peanuts classics, plus great Latin and Brazilian inspired tunes, and several previously unreleased recordings, such as “Blues for Peanuts” and superb version of “Autumn Leaves.” You cannot go wrong with any of the tracks on either CD. Press play, pour some wine, light a few candles, clink glasses, and prepare to enjoy one of American music’s greatest gifts to humanity.If you are a true fan of what you hear on this anthology, I highly recommend adding additional albums to your collection, including A Charlie Brown Christmas, A Flower is a Lonesome Thing, The Latin Side of Vince Guaraldi, Vince Guaraldi with the San Francisco Boys Chorus (which has very cool versions of Bob Dylan’s “Blowin’ in the Wind’ and the Beatles’ “Elanor Rigby”), Jazz Impressions of Black Orpheus, and North Beach (my favorite of his individual albums).If you love jazz – even if you are just a casual listener – The Definitive Vince Guaraldi will make you a believer in the power of music to heal, to make happy, and to help dull the pain of daily life. Peanuts songs may be the gateway drug to Vince's musical treasures for younger listeners, but beyond these wonderful, well-loved tunes, there is an ocean of possibilities to explore, one perfect song and piano performance at a time.",[]

"E-Z LOK 400-5 Threaded Inserts for Wood, Installation Kit, Brass, Includes 5/16-18 Knife Thread Inserts (5), Drill, Installation Tool",E-Z LOK,"E-Z LOK Knife Thread inserts provide an easy to use solution for adding machine threads to wood. Ideal for use in virtually any wood (not recommended for plywood), these inserts use a proprietary external thread for superior holding power.","[""Industrial & Scientific"",""Fasteners"",""Threaded Inserts"",""Helical Threaded Inserts""]",‏  ‎ EZ-Lok,,"Supplied with insert tool DT-428 vs 500-3 as pictured. You cannot use the same tool to install 1/4-20 or M6 inserts like you could with the 500-3 tool. Otherwise kit is of good quality.Used inserts on a table top and worked greatTook some rolling feet off chair legs and used these to attach some fixed feet. Made it easy.Ordered more so they must work.This Kit and Insert aare so easy to use!I'm sure that I will order more for future projects.I picked this up to make turning Bottle toppers and a few other things easier, the nice insert making it a lot easier to mount on the lathe and install the bottle stoppers.The issue I ran into with this was that the driver worked to install the insert well enough but it also didn't want to release the insert and instead of leaving it behind in the wood as it should, it would pull it out 50% of the time. Maybe a little lube on the threads will make that go easier? The other thing I found was on about 50% of the inserts the threads just rip right off.I'm using the provided drill bit, driver, and inserts. When they work they work well enough but the failure rate is a bit high for my liking. I suggest using some lube on the driver threads to help it release on the way out. I tend to use hardwoods for these projects so maybe the inserts need to have better material so the threads don't peel off?I wouldn't say - don't buy this product - just know what your getting into and try to minimize issues by knowing that this can be an issue in some cases.This is an update after several more uses - The main issue I have is the driver - it gets stuck just about every time and I can back the drill off without pulling out the insert. The Driver needs to be redesigned so it will release from the insert way easier... I've not wasted more money on trashed expensive wood blanks than this tool cost.I see a lot of good reviews and lot of bad reviews. To clarify things a bit: these are a well known and often used inserts for woodworkers of all sorts. Installing these inserts correctly requires that you have either a drill press, tapping arbor or have at least taken steps to ensure that the angle of installation is perfectly and consistently 90 degrees to the entry point. You will need to pre drill a pilot hole for these and the supplied brad point bit is a perfect fit in maple, but nothing in woodwork is a guarantee. Very dense exotics and the like would benefit from (and may require) an additional tapping step before installation. The installation tool is really handy and safer than a homemade lock nut because it's hardened. Thinking of doing this by hand and eye? Just don't - You have a good chance of getting these stuck at a bad angle and wasting your project. I've installed dozens of these with great results, but I struggled before figuring them out - Use as directed or Suffer.I tried to use these in hardwood, they were extremely difficult to install. The tool broke off in the first one, I had to remove it and repair with a piece of dowel. I wound up increasing the diameter of all the holes and applying paste wax to the threads. It was still a struggle.The main problem with this kit is that it comes with a 25/64 drill bit, which into hardwoods like oak, is too small and the install tool will just shred the top of the insert nut. Even with a 13/32 bit it is tight and the top of the insert is often damaged....so either the size of the drill bit needs to be revisited, the insert nut itself needs to be stronger, or it should be noted that this doesn't support use in hardwood and a different product offered in its place.If you are going to use this definitely test it on some spare stock of the same kind of wood you plan to use it with (multiple times). Likely you'll have to buy a new drill bit (or two) and experiment to get the right size.Also, I recommend using this with a drill guide or drill press.Je n'arrivais pas à bien visser mes inserts avec cet outils dans du frêne. Ça échappait avant d'être complètement visser. J'y parvenais beaucoup mieux avec un boulon visser dans l'insert et deux nuts bloqué pour stopper l'insert. Une fois l'insert en place, juste a faire marche arrière et le boulon se dévisse de l'insert qui lui reste en place.The kit is a little expensive , but it a nice starter ... after that , you can buy 1/4-20 inserts , 1/4-28 and even the M6 inserts , they all work with the same drill bit and installation toolThe drill bit that comes with this kit is clearly too small, I’m building dining table out of white oak, luckily I decided to try these out on scrap wood first. Stripped 3 of 3 I tried to install before they even got close to being flush. I’ll try using a bit bigger drill bit, these may be good for soft woods? But definitely not hard wood. I’ve seen others with an Allen key type socket for installation, likely wouldn’t strip as easily.It is not possible to install these threaded inserts well without the included drill bit and insert tool.","[""Installation Kit With Inserts, Drill & Driver"",""Quickly Install With Included Tools"",""Brass, UNC Threads"",""Provides a strong machine thread in wood"",""Designed For Use In Furniture, Cabinetry, Storm Windows and Marine Applications""]"

Just wish they weren't so pricey for some hanging folders.DurableI don’t find this to be gray at all. It’s more of a beige. Maybe a mix of gray and beige. It works. It holds. It does the job. But this isn’t grayI got a new desk and needed hanging folders. I couldn't find purple ones locally and never had any issues like this before but these from Amazon do not fit. I'll need to stuff this drawer full to prevent them from coming off one of the rails and I'm not convinced that will even prevent this from happening. Wouldn't buy these again. VERY frustrating.Not flimsy or cheap, a very good product.Glad to see Smead has stronger steel in their hanging folders . I have bought a lot of files over the past few years from other companies and the steel hanger just collapses after a short time of use because the steel is so thin and crappy. I took a chance on a Smead product thru amazon and ordered these hanging files and honestly didn't expect much and I'd probably have to return. To my surprise they a far stronger than the other companies products, finally some quality coming back than the throw-away nation attitude. I stopped buying the other companies and have been the past few years rummaging through my parents much older hanging files to reuse them since they were made better. Hope Smead continues to offer sound quality products . Just looked at their website and found they are a ""woman owned"" company, made in the USA product and Eco green conscience. That makes me feel more awesome about this product purchase.I like the gray color, it matches my steel cabinet great but I was shorted one tab. Oh well! I have to buy another set, maybe I will get lucky and get 26 in the next box. Maybe!!Con: Gray looks more like brown. (I added a photo showing Smead's gray compared to Amazon Basics' gray).Pro: They feel sturdy and are uniform in color from inside and out compared to the other brands where the inside is cardboard color.There were no instructions on how to put the tabs on the hanging file folders which I didn't like. The Inserts for the Tabs are all there but the clear plastic 1/5 tabs themselves(7 of the tabs)are missing. Please send those in the 2nd order. Thanks!Love these! Great quality & the colour is perfect.quality and shipping quickness is greatI like the colour.Love the colour. Worked well with the container I purchased to organize kids school memories. Doesn't have the clear protective strip on edge that others have but will likely be durable enough for this purpose.","[""Includes 25 letter size hanging file folders (11-3/4\"" W x 9-1/4\"" H exclusive of rods and tabs) that keep your papers neatly upright in desk drawers and file cabinets"",""Each hanging folder features a 1/5-cut repositionable poly tab and coated rod tips that slide easily in file drawers for hassle-free organizing and access to documents"",""The clear poly tabs have replaceable white tab inserts and can be positioned in several locations on the front or back panel so you can create a customized filing system"",""Proudly made in the USA, these 11 pt. colored stock hanging file folders contain 10% recycled content, 10% post-consumer material and are SFI Sourcing Certified"",""Organize different types of files by color-coding for quick and easy identification with these maroon hanging file folders; Use with colored interior folders to prevent misfiling""]"

"Bluemoon Homes Sheet Sets for King Size Bed Egyptian Cotton 800 Thread Count Cotton Sheets King Size Set Deep Pocket Upto 16'' - Extra Long-Staple Cotton King Sheets, Sateen Weave, Soft Sheets(Taupe)",Bluemoon Homes,"Q. What is 100% Egyptian cotton? Ans. The strong and unbroken yarn of Egyptian cotton results in a fabric that is flexible. This means that 100% Egyptian cotton bed sheets feel super soft and can last even longer than regular cotton. It also doesn't pill, unlike another cotton, even after many washes. Q. What are the fabrics used in this product? Ans. The thread and yarn we use to make of 100% long-staple Egyptian cotton fabric and gorgeous sateen weave. Egyptian cotton produces fibers that are far longer than other cotton. These fibers are smaller in diameter, longer in length, and much stronger than other types of cotton have.   We Work for Customer Needs Q. What is the difference between cotton and Egyptian cotton? Ans. Egyptian cotton is stronger than regular cotton, therefore longer-lasting. It's partly thanks to the extra-long fibers that Egyptian cotton plants produce, making yarns tougher yet oh so soft. Q. Are Egyptian cotton sheets worth it? Ans. Egyptian cotton sheets are often considered the height of luxury. They're prized for their superior softness, durability, and breathability. The distinct feel of Egyptian cotton sheets comes from the unique properties of Egyptian cotton itself.   Q. What's a good thread count on sheets? Ans. Thread count refers to the number of horizontal and vertical threads per square inch. Generally, the higher the thread count, the softer the sheet, and the more likely it will wear well — or even soften — over time. Good sheets range anywhere from 200 to 1000, although you'll occasionally see numbers over 1,000. Q. How often should you wash Egyptian cotton sheets? Ans. Normally, you should wash your Egyptian cotton sheets every 7-14 days to remove the sweat and oils that might otherwise cause your sheets to turn yellow.       Q. What is the dimension of this item? Ans. Choose the sheet set that fits your needs. Twin: 1 Fitted Sheet 39” X 75"" x 18"" deep pocket, 1 Flat Sheet 66"" X 96"" and 2 Standard Pillowcases 20"" X 30""Full: 1 Fitted Sheet 54"" X 75"" x 18"" deep pocket , 1 Flat Sheet 81"" X 96"" and 2 Standard Pillowcases 20"" X 30""Queen: 1 Fitted Sheet 60"" X 80"" x 18"" deep pocket , 1 Flat Sheet 90"" X 102"" and 2 Standard Pillowcases 20"" X 30""King: 1 Fitted Sheet 76"" X80"" x 18"" deep pocket , 1 Flat Sheet 102"" X 108"" and 2 King Pillowcases 20"" X 40""California King: 1 Fitted Sheet 72"" X 84"" x 18"" deep pocket , 1 Flat Sheet 102"" X 108"" and 2 King Pillowcases 20"" X 40"" Q. Do they have elastic all around the sheet or just on the corners? Ans. Elastic is only on corners the expertly tailored Corner elasticized fitted sheet with the durable elastic that goes all the corner side around the bed. The size that fits almost any mattress: to ensure a secure fit with Deep Pockets (up to 18 inches) that won’t ride up or move around in the middle of the night, staying smooth, snug, and wrinkle-free. Q. Is this item is durable? Ans. Always wash in normal water (30 degrees) to avoid wrinkles on the sheet. Remove your bedding from the washing machine promptly and Iron out the remaining moisture on the appropriate heat setting. Recommended for regular wash & short dry cycles for superior softness.   Q. How our sheets are best? Ans. Our sheets look royal and are also super comfy. Our bed sets go through rigorous quality checks and clearances before they reach you. We make better homes. Q. Which is better microfiber or Egyptian cotton sheets? Ans. Cotton sheets are more breathable than microfiber and won't trap heat as easily, providing a more comfortable sleep. However, microfiber sheets can be more durable than cotton sheets, as natural fibers–particularly less expensive cotton options–can break down more easily with frequent washes.

That first pair was long - I had deliberately ordered ""tall"" so I could tuck them into my Muck Boots. This pair is regular length, and I ordered these specifically for appointments with the Orthopaedist and for when I need to go get imaging done on my hip and back. No metal, EASY on and off, and very comfortable when washed properly, even for someone as fussy as I am about materials ;) .The material is also reasonably cool to wear, which matters A LOT for those of us who live in a hot and humid climate. They are sized lightly, but I wash everything before I wear it so I can't comment on how the sizing feels. - When you do wash them, BE SURE to wash Inside-Out, on Cool or Warm, and on Gentle cycle - dry on Low and pull out while they are still very lightly damp, turn right-side out, and then lay flat of hang to let them dry the rest of the way. It sounds like more of a bother than it actually is,since all of my lightweight color items get washed pretty much the same way. - The XXL in Regular Length fits exactly as I expect an XXL to fit, roomy in the seat. (I can't stand anything tight any more, so I could have gone with an XL but an more comfortable the XXL, especially when sitting in waiting rooms and so on.) - The Color was actually nicer than the photo appears on my monitor - more neutral and a wee bit darker, more like what I'd call a light to medium taupe. - I do add elastic in the waist - I run it through where the ties go and put a few stitches in by hand to hold the ends in place where they won't show. Also, the emphasis in on ""lightweight"" here - they're *not* designed to be worn for doing heavy-duty construction work, LOL! The stitching is similarly lightweight. I don't think scrubs are generally designed to last for decades, given the things that medical professionals often end up coming into contact with, so if you are looking for heavy-duty work pants, these are not that. - I gave 4 stars rather than 5, because I do need to add elastic, and because the stitching could stand to be a bit sturdier, BUT all in all, these fit my needs well, and the price is decent.I got it in my size and it was too big the material feels kinda scratchyThese pants are absolutely not for a woman with a larger waist. They are cut completely straight, no curves, so if you have a large waist then the legs are also extremely wide. They looked extremely baggy and unprofessional which I didn't notice right away due to getting dressed in a hurry that morning. I wore them to work and my coworkers were staring at them like, what in the hell is she wearing? They might be ok if you are very thin or tend toward a straight up and down figure.Size of the scrub pants is larger than I expected. I should have got Size small. Good experience.I read the reviews and most of them said that you should size down. I ordered a size Large and they fit well. I am full figured, bottom heavy with booty & thick thighs. 45, 39, 50 inches. Size 14 / 16. The pants are about 3 inches too long but I am only 5'4"" tall. Pants are comfortable and light weight, no stretch. Glad I ordered in multiple colors.I am going against what has been said in other reviews concerning size. I wear Med, waist 32 and bought Med. What I found when I tried them on is the drawstrings seem to work a little different. Most of us expect that if we grab the drawstrings and pull the strings out away from us, while pulling the garment back towards us, we can cinch up the drawstrings and tie them off. What I noticed here is the drawstring coming out the right hole on the waist is actually coming from the LEFT side, and visa-versa. Not really an unusual thing, but uncommon. I have gym shorts that do the same thing. So instead of pulling the drawstring out away from your body, pull the left drawstring to the LEFT and the right drawstring to the RIGHT and the waist should cinch up.Word of caution - be sure to tie a knot in each end of the drawstring, else it might come out during the wash.I read the reviews about size. I wear scrubs daily and wear them out pretty quick. I'm 6' and wear a 38 waist / 32 inseam pant. I went with the large and they fit perfect as far as scrubs go. 2 pockets are nice and handy. No elastic is a plus and they tie securely with a single bow knot. Kinda thin but not see through. Dry quickly. They wash well. Price is just what I was looking for. I got the black ones and they go well with my stylish fruit-of-the-loom pocket tees. I look professional, feel comfortable whether relaxing or saving the world with my intelligent application of exertion. Sometimes I work really hard too. Lotsa sweat but no chafing discomfort. Worn under anti-contamination clothing in high heat and humid conditions. Perfect.I was disappointed in these scrubs. Compared to my other Landau sets that I ordered from a medical supplier, these are stiff, collect massive amounts of lint when laundered (even when only washed and dried with other scrubs), and are a good 2 inches shorter in the leg. They are now my backup pair when all others are dirty.Really thin cotton but good quality, bit too big for me but absolutely comfortableLa relación calidad- precio es la esperada, la tela no es la mejor calidad se siente rasposa supongo mejorará con las puestas levemente, se que en el modelo especifica ser unisex por lo cual no te da mucha forma pero ok eso lo dice ... lo que no te especifican es que es unitalla, en el pedido especifique talla S y me llega uno donde está etiquetado SML .... no me parece correcto, así que cuidado por que este asumo que es un M me queda relativamente flojo pero si le llegara a alguien que pide L definitivamente no le queda ...Check the sizes carefully. The size L I purchased originally fell to the floor even when tied to its smallest. Size M is almost perfect for a 35/36 waist. Still too big because the waist strings do not go any tighter.Tela sintética me gusta mucho esta línea de Scrub zone, sub marca de Landau porque es transpirable y luce mucho el color aún después de haberlo lavado varias veces. Trae bolsa lateral tipo cargo (sin tapa ni botón pero es amplia y bolsa de atrás.Great pants for wearing doing just about any thing around the house from gardening, to shop work or housework.",[]

My old one had a slide out for the bottom tray, this doesn’t. That’s the only thing I miss.This heat press is not the one pictured or described. Yes it works and heats up. But I was very disappointed that the bottom base DOESN'T slide out like advertised. That's the reason why I picked this one. Also doesn't have none of the features listed disted. Size is correct, I did get a 15x15 inch press. The hat press attachment probably won't work correctly. The material on the hat press is not attached/glued on correctly. Haven't tried it yet. The heat press in general is not the correct color, the adjustment wheel on the back is not the same mine has a thin flimsy knob.. the top handles are loose even after tightening the entire top panel is loose.Up on opening box found that the knob was broke in several spots.The box wasn't damaged from delivery. My husband had to glue the piece's together.Reasonably priced works well easy assembly. No complaints 👌🏾It's functional so I kept it and use it on occasion but in hindsight I wish I'd returned it for something else. The directions are pretty useless and it's not user intuitive to figure out how to set the time and temp. And when I do think I've figured it out, it'll reach that temp but then it still keeps going up. And when you start the timer it's SUPER loud and vibrates the entire table; scares my cats. It gets the job done with HTV but I more often use my much smaller Cricut because it's easier to work with.It took me a while to figure it out,but love itLove this machine very easy to useLove the weight of it. It's easy to use.Práctico de usar y fácilExcellent productWell worth its money!","[""Portable & One-Hand: Our 7 x 8 inch heat press machine has the speed of an industrial heat press and the convenience of an iron. Our easy press has a unique vibration function allowing you to release your hands. You don’t need to press it all the time, after setting the time and temperature. Once the countdown ends, it will be accompanied by the sound of a beep."",""Dual Tubes for Faster Heating Up: With dual tubes, our iron press could evenly heat to precise temperatures at higher degrees 392℉/ 200℃. 800W double-tube design ensures the effect more uniform and better transfer quality. Compared with the single tube, our temperature difference is only about 5℃ between the center and the edge. Help you save lots of heat-up time when using our shirt press."",""Sensitive Touch Display: The 7 x 8\"" heating surface is much larger than other mini heat press, so you can easily finish full t-shirt designs with one heating. Besides, the temperature and time settings can accommodate a wide variety of materials and heat settings. Furthermore this press has a unique pressure display, helping you to apply precise pressure and making HTV work so incredibly easy and pro!"",""Insulation Plate Base: Our shirt heat press comes with an insulation base to rest in, making it securer to use around your kids and pets. The top and side handles ensure your hands are kept away from the hot plate. No worries of you are going to burn yourself down. Our heat press will allow you say goodbye to this situation and always have a clean and professional transfer."",""Lasting Results: A small heat-press for uniquely shaped, extra-small objects.

Only thing i hate though is how loud the remote beeper is!!! I can't turn it on in the mornings because it'll disturb my family. Which they can mute the remote. Also mine didn't come with branding, which I don't mind but it seems there are other companies selling the same model. I just got this one since I saw it on TikTok and how they sold 20k plus units.

I placed it dead center of the sink, whereu I had a small shelf and no cabinet of course), drilled 2 holes, bought a nice 3 wire black extension cord, hooked the light up and tucked the cord in neatly, securing it with wire staples from the hardware store. The light is PERFECT in the evening and at light to light up the kitchen counter and floor while not disturbing the living room connected to it. The overhead lights were too much, the microwave lights wayyyy too dim, this one is perfect and the correct Kelvin color for the evening. Not a blue white that I use overhead to cook and cut with. If your remotely handy this LED light is a quick install and priced right. I’m probably buying a couple more for my laundry area and other areas like a closet. The extension cord idea makes the light go where you need it, if you don’t permanently mount it. Plus no junction box work either. So add $10 to the price of it for the extension cord and wire staples. That will be your total expense. Built in switch is exactly what I needed also. I control it alone.

I ordered the WhiteFang Beach Tent Anti-UV Portable Sun Shade Shelter because it had high ratings. The comments which drew me to it were that the poles were thicker than the average poles. I received the beach tent two or three days after I ordered it. I immediately opened it in my living room. I purchased the mint, and the color is what I expected. Because I have set up several tents, the set up for this was a breeze. Yet, anyone who can read the easy-to-follow instructions, will be able to put this up with maybe a tiny bit of patience (if this type of set up is something foreign to you). This is a bit larger than I expected, which I am happy about. The day after receiving the tent, my husband set it up outside for my 5-year-old grandson to 'camp'. My husband is 5'10, and he is able to stretch out in it (parallel with the opening panel, with head at one side window and feet at the other). My grandson, husband, and myself laid down as though we were actually camping, and it had enough room for all of us to lie on our back. The tent is easy to take down and roll up, before placing it into the storage/carry bag. This all stated, I did purchase it to use at the waterpark this summer, as well as to bring when we go other places where we may want some protection from the sun. It is quite compact, and will easily fit in my suitcase if we ever go to a place like Hawaii (saves on tent rental on the beach). The entire front panel unzips, making one large opening. My 5-year-old grandson can lie down with his head at the opposite side (i.e. the back panel) of the front panel, and his feet are still inside the tent. I forgot to see how far my husband's feet came out of the tent. There are three vented window panels, one one each of the sides, as well as one on the back panel. Even with the flaps placed in the up position, a breeze will be allowed to come through the tent (due to the flaps not being zipped, but rather, held in place by loops). There are anchors that can be used to put into the ground in order to secure it down; and, there are pockets on the outside walls that can hold sand when at the beach. The material seems to be of good quality. With good and proper treatment and care, I am confident this beach tent will last a very long time! One suggestion I have, is to place a tarp/blanket type item under the tent floor to protect it from things that might poke a hole in it, or cause wear (we do this with all of our tents in order to protect the integrity of the flooring, and to help it remain in great condition). For this tent, I have a fold up picnic-type blanket that we have used in the waterpark over the past few years. It will be perfect for protecting our floor.","[""Fiberglass,Mesh"",""Imported"",""8.0mm Thickened Fiberglass Rods We increased the thickness of the fiberglass rods to 8.0mm to make it more flexible, sturdy and durable. It can support the tent more stable and will keep shape even after long time use."",""UPF 50+ Protection & Excellent Ventilation Our beach tent is made of premium 210t sun-proof material coated polyester, it can effectively block heat and 98% of the harmful UV rays. 3 super large roll up mesh windows increase airflow and reduce the temperature. It helps keep summer's scorching heat away from your family and allows you to enjoy the oceanic breeze with a comfortable space."",""Stability & Windproof Good rods are the key to keeping a tent stable and windproof, so we use the 8mm fiberglass rods. And Our beach tent is also equipped with 3 sandbags, 8 steel stakes, 6 sand stakes and guy lines. The combination of socket and stake can make the tent grip more firmly and resist strong wind more effectively."",""Omni-directional Zipper for Added Privacy Our beach tent uses omni-directional zipper design. It allows you to open and close the floor mat from the inside, outside, and as well as from both sides. It’s very convenient to get in and out. The extended front floor provides extra room for more activities, which can be zipped up when you need extra private space, or are away from the tent."",""Light Weight & Portable Our beach tent is light weight, portable and easy to fold down with a compact carrying bag. Small size makes it easier to travel and store. It's convenient to carry anywhere you want. Just go on a beach trip with your family!

Couldn't be happier!!!I purchased 2 of these lights. The look is nice. It does take a bit to get the cord to hang straight since it is wrapped up and bent up in shipping. The glass quality is very cheap. It is very thin and has a rough cut edge on the bottom but since it won't be touched I will live with it. The bottom opening dimension is 6.5"" as stated in the description but the widest portion of the light is 8"" wide towards the top of the bell shape.The four stars for installation are because it always takes two people to install--one to hold it up, and the other to connect the wiring. We used a round ""old fashioned"" 40 watt yellow dimmer bulb, which looks great over our kitchen counter.I love this , it definitely adds to your house !

The lampshades were nice but I didn’t like they did not hang from a solid rod.This lamp has a beautiful shape and is of substantial size - exactly what I was looking for.

However, I am new to the craft, so I used the gold to add a simple vinyl to my cricut explore 2. I had no problems with getting the vinyl out of the tube, transferring it over to the cricut, or anything, it was a seamless first vinyl project.Tonight I decided it was time to do the project I got the cricut for. I tried to get the white, black, and red out of their tubes and it was horrible. There are marks on the vinyl where it stuck to the plastic tube, I had to yank it out of the tube to get any of it, so there are wrinkles and creases in the vinyl now. It is close to unuseable. I'm not sure why but with this project the transfer tape didn't work as well either. Overall it was an unpleasant craft moment. Made me wonder if people were right, and I should have not worked with cricut material to begin with. I've got some tubes coming from Cricut directly and I have the silver tube unopened and purchased a separate pink sparkle vinyl, so I will see if it is a problem with all cricut packaging or if it's just this set.","[""STRONG AND PERMANENT: Our one-of-a-kind adhesive vinyl can be applied easily to the widest variety of base materials.

I can’t believe how excited I am about a trash/recycle can, but I am! They are going to be perfect! This can was perfect, for me, for three primary reasons:1) I didn’t want people to have to touch a lid, to put something in the can2) I didn’t want to have to worry about rain3) It’s the perfect sizeWe are not smokers, so I plan to put a plant, on top of each can, to cover the ashtray.I will send a photo, when our pool deck is finished. Happy summer, everyone!I had asked before ordering if it took tall kitchen garbage bags. Folks said no...I ordered it anyway (thinking I'd just have to get different sized bags for it)... When it arrived today I went ahead and tried tall kitchen - and THEY DO FIT. To clarify, I wasn't as concerned about if the bag goes all the way to the bottom (I think it actually does that too, put I put a brick in there to weight it down anyway). My concern was it fitting around the top and securing... and a tall kitchen bag DOES fit VERY nicely and even snuggly around the top of this 15 gallon model! That makes it nearly perfect!Just FYI on other things I didn't get from other reviews or pictures regarding the 'ash tray': it is 2 pieces (upper and lower)... the bin part is recessed and is attached with screws to the easily removable 'top' plastic assembly - so to empty the bin you have to remove top of the can and dump it (nothing to it, just lifts up, and if you were going to empty into that garbage bag anyway...). And then the upper part you 'see' and use when looking at it fully assembled is attached over the bin part at the corners with Velcro tabs (very sturdily) and has a pyramid type shape to the inner section. So... the only part I am concerned about over time is when you lift the top part of the ash tray off of the bin part of the ash tray assembly (which has to be done to empty the bin), the little screws that hold the bin part look like they might rust if they ever got wet. And to wash the bin (in sink for instance) you'll have to take the whole top to the sink and deal with that bulkiness. Did not warrant reducing the stars for me (no biggie, just fyi). But would be nice if the bin part and top part of the 2-piece ash tray could both be removed from the lid. I suppose I could remove the screws and fasten the bin in a removable way...I'll go to the building we put it at and try to take pictures of what I am talking about (should have done that 2 hours ago before placement).I love this trash can for my large patio. Bigger and better than I expected. Just arrived as expected, but wasn’t expecting it to be as nice as it is. I got the beige or taupe? I’m using left over trash bags that are 55 gallon. I had thought this was going to be a cheap plastic but it’s not. I was going to sit a concrete block in the bottom but will not be Necessary, as it will sit back on my patio under cover of patio so will stand up to wind. Love it, Thank you Sacco and AmazonWe purchased this as an outdoor trash receptacle for our downtown offices where we have a lot of homeless folks who create a good amount of trash. We wondered if we provided a place for them to dispose of their throwaways, they wouldn't just leave their junk on the sidewalk and in the gutters.Finding the right receptacle was a challenge, and this one has worked very well for us. First of all, we needed something that just couldn't be carried off by someone. However, practical logistics required the item not be too heavy (some outdoors trash bins are made of concrete and weight several hundred pounds), because we would have to maneuver the thing into place. What we did with the Safeco product was anchor it by putting two screw-stakes through the bottom (the same kind used to leash dogs in yards), then weighed the bin down with a 50-pound bag of sand. We drilled a hole for a padlock to hold the top of the bin in place, so no trash pickers could remove it to undo the purpose the receptacle was meant to serve. Then the thing was ready for business and we looked forward to see what would happen.There has been evidence that some have tried to wrestle the top off (who knows why?). But both the top has stayed secure and the receptacle itself has not been budged.And even better news: provide a place for people to put their trash, and they actually will use it!All in all, this had proven to be a great product.It’s very good product and they do stay behind and help they have good customer serviceMoney worthI bought two of these for a store that I am opening. These are the perfect size for entry trash cans since they are slightly larger than a standard kitchen style trash can and can hold a good amount of trash so it's easy for any employee to empty it than an industrial size that is a pain to empty without needing another trash can to haul it to the dumpster. Highly recommend. The only downside is that it's made of lightweight plastic so it may require some weight in the bottom to avoid being blown over when it's empty. Good value for the money.We needed a waste basket on entering the building from the garage to the lobby with an ashtray - just in case someone was smoking and this fit the bill. It's attractive and owners were pleased with its look.Amazing. You won’t find better at this price. Easy to clean and maintain. Use the dimensions listed in the description for bag size. 42 gallon bags are the size I use and they fit great.Very happy with product, durable and exactly what i wanted.

Also, we have 30 Days Return Policy with free return label within United State.       Diamond Clarity A diamond’s clarity is measured by the existence or absence of visible flaws. Tiny surface blemishes or internal inclusions, even those seen only under magnification, can alter the brilliance of the diamond and thus affect its value. Clarity levels begin with flawless (FL, IF), followed by very, very slight (VVS1, VVS2), very slight (VS1, VS2), slightly included (SI1, SI2), and included (I1, I2, and I3). Diamond Carat Weight Carat refers to a diamond's weight. One carat, the traditional unit of measurement for diamonds, is approximately 0.2 grams. You may also hear the weight of a diamond referred to in points. One carat is equivalent to 100 points, so a 75-point diamond is equal to 0.75 carats. Because they are rarer, larger diamonds have greater value per carat, so the value of a diamond rises exponentially to its size. Diamond Cut Diamond cut refers to the proportions, finish, symmetry and polish of the diamonds. These factors determine the intensity and brilliance of a diamond. A well-cut diamond is proportioned, symmetrical, and polished; these are typically the most expensive types of diamond. The width and depth of the cut can have an effect on how light travels within the diamond and how it exits in the form of brilliance.","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Women"",""Jewelry"",""Rings"",""Statement""]",Katarina,womens,"Love the way the ring fits and looks.

In 1993, Dr. Bill Vaughn developed the world’s first energy gel to help his daughter perform better during ultra-marathons, and GU has been helping to propel the world’s most successful extreme athletes to success ever since. GU Energy Gel sustains all forms of athletic activity with a highly compact, portable, and calorie-dense packet that is loaded with carbohydrates that can be rapidly absorbed. Branched-chain amino acids limit muscle fiber damage and increase speed of recovery, and extra electrolytes help maintain water balance. Some flavors feature caffeine to increase concentration. While the original formula has been tweaked and evolved over the years, the end result is still the same: GU Energy Gels fuel the best endurance athletes in the world. GU Original Energy Gel comes in a wide variety of good tasting flavors.

I got these for marathon training, I only use them during long runs around the 4 mile mark and they definitely help. I havent had any issues with them popping open and they’re quick and easy to open. They also haven’t given me any GI issues like other brands I’ve tried. So far so good, would purchase again.These are my go-to for long runs. The taste is great and they do what they're supposed to with an energy boost. I take the first one after 45min, and then one every 45min after that. Definitely need water to stop it gumming up in the mouth, but no digestive issues.These are my go-to when I'm doing any activities that warrant fueling. Easy to consume, tastes great and easy to carry.When I finish with all my energy, this thing help me to get back,works great on an empty stomach.They are easy to consume, taste great and keep me running.I just don't like to have to carry the package after consuming it....Other than getting the giant container of gu. We would rather have a variety of flavors though, especially for long runs. But we wish it were easier to pick the variety of flavors. We love all but jet black. They really help us power through as we are training for a marathon. I also wish the top stayed attached like some other brands since it's easy for them to slip out.Love the vanilla flavor.Using this for years during my runs!Always use the stuff on my hikes and MTB ridesI know there are cheaper ones out there by different brands but I decided to try this. Thick and and a great taste. I haven't tried all the flavours yet but early indications point to good things. If this is the same people who make deserts for sale in all major supermarkets then no wonder!I use GU as I feel like I have eaten something when I use them BUT they are very sticky so make sure your carrying a rubbish bag and a wet wipe when out on those long runsThese are great. Previously used SIS which were a bit more watery and didn't 'last' as long. First tried them as were at the pit stops on the silverstone half marathon. The GU ones are quite thick, bit like piped icing going onto a cake. Taste great without being sickly, recommends around every 45mins so last longer than others do. Overall very pleasedSwitched to GU gels from High5 six months ago and prefer the GU consistency/flavours and I carry fewer of them. I use one every 45-60 minutes during a marathon and don't get the sticky residue on my hands and clothes that I got with lighter, sugary gels. The Vanilla Bean and also the Chocolate Outrage are two of my favourite tasting GU's but Lime, Strawberry and Salted Caramel also very pleasant. Great product.These taste pretty good, but they are very pricey and come in packaging that's unrecyclable in the UK.

What are you to say, “Looks Pretty!”?  How can you give a true review if you haven’t yet used the item?  It has been a couple of months now…so here’s the scoop!I ordered this because of the color (wine/black). I was excited to have a case that was something other than black or white.I put it together with no problems - all fit as intended.  About a day later I started having issues with the rubber piece pulling away each time I would pull the phone from my pocket. This continues even now.  It’s kind of annoying to be honest.  Sometimes, it looks as if the corner of the phone has caught on a hook and is pulled a good two inches off.  It’s not ripped, just dangling.  It can’t possibly protect the phone when it’s hanging like a limp appendage.Then there is the color issue.  The coloring of these cases is an overlay.  Within 48 hours I could see the edges starting to wear away.  The plastic underneath is white and shows in stark contrast to everything else.  This wine colored, now candy cane striped case I bought a couple months ago looks like I’ve had it a year or two. I’m already looking to replace it.",null

Proudly made in McCrery, Arkansas, USA.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Kitchen & Bath Fixtures"",""Bathroom Fixtures"",""Toilets & Toilet Parts"",""Toilet Seats""]",‏  ‎ Centoco Manufacturing Corporation,,"The round seat fits my commode perfectly, and so far it’s tight as a drum, not so much as a hint of movement.The whole thing seems very sturdy without being heavy or cumbersome. Looks good too, perfect match.The plastic nuts that attach to the plastic bolts that mount the seat onto the toilet have a little “projectile” on each one. I assume they’re a thumb grip but there wasn’t enough room for the nut to turn against the commode so I had to get rid of the part that stuck out - a lot harder than I thought. Very hard plastic can’t be cut with a utility knife and a saw is too big. A cutting tool such as Dremel might work but I solved the problem rather quickly. I melted the projectile off using a match. If you try this take care not to start a fire, and I held the nut with a pair of pliers for better grip and to avoid any hot plastic. Be very careful not to melt into the nut itself or it’ll ruin the grooves and you won’t be able to use it.Once it melted down close to the nut I took a pair of pliers and broke off the remaining part while it was still hot. It snapped right off with no trouble then the nut was clear to screw onto the bolt. I did both nuts the same way, easy peasy.I found this toilet seat easy to install. It's comfortable to sit on and seems to be solidly built. I liked the fact that it came with large hinges and silicone seals that help keep the seat in place.I purchased this seat to replace a broken one on my Gerber toilet. My biggest problem was matching the correct color, not knowing if the CENTOCORE color bone or biscuit was a match. I ended up with the bone color and it looks good.For the price, I'm very pleased with the quality. As it is new, I can't speak to its longevity, but right now, it ticks all the boxes for me.I posted some photos to give you a closer look and hope that they, along with my experience, help you out a bit with your choice. Thank you!How do you review a toilet seat? It works, I don't fall in the toilet etc.This is the greatest toilet seat I have bought in the last 50 years!!! Very Sturdy for my 250 pound body!!! Great supports under the seat!!! If you are looking for a sturdy seat for heavy folks like me - buy this one!!! Dr. GF""Quality"" is the best way to describe this product. 30 years of residential and commercial repair and maintenance and I have not installed any better that I recall. It's the sturdiness of wood and cleanup of plastic. I don't think you can do anything better than installing this Centorcore seat.Very easy to install and looks sturdy and good quality.It is sturdy and was easy to install.Needed a replacement seat for toilet at my mother's house. This was very solid, affordable and easy to install. And was perfect size to match prior seat. Be careful when lifting the plastic screw covers. They are kind of fragile. I pulled one up to install the plastic screw and it broke off. But it fit back into place with no adhesive and has stayed on. Will purchase again.I'm super impressed by this low cost, easy to install toilet seat. This one is solid enough to carry my weight without buckling when I'm sitting ON the lid! I could never do this with the one I had purchased from Canadian Tire. I'm super pleased.WOW! I went to several local stores, prices were crazy. For this quality the seats were close to $100 or more.The seat installed easily and what a BIG difference from the full plastic seat we had for 4 years. The Plastic hinge snapped. This new seat is really solid and will last a long time. It does not have silent self-closing. Make sure you check the type of toilet you have whether Regular Round or Elongated. Double check the type and color before ordering. Fast Delivery, Excellent Quality and Price. Thanks!Not much more to add as the other reviews cover it all. I had trouble finding a toilet seat that would match my measurements, but I probably was overthinking it. The length is pretty standard at 18 1/2” for most elongated seats, but the width seems to very quite a bit within different manufacturers. This fit my required 15 1/2 inch width falling slightly short by about 1/3 inch on each side the toilet bowl. It’s not an issue whatsoever. Easy to install, a nice glossy white. Looks like it should hold up well.Perfect fit on my very old low, elongated Crane toilet. Replaced an old, discoloured plastic version. This wood version is solid and doesn't have the ""give"" of plastic yet is very comfortable. We all feel well supported. Sturdy. Doesn't shift (it might with enough twisting and turning while seated, but in our family, we tend not to move around too much while we're focused on the job at hand). Perfect colour match (Crane white). Such an easy install. It actually took me longer to carefully (for fear of cracking them) pry open the hinge covers than to do the full install. That would be my only negative comment: the hinge covers are a softer plastic which felt like they could break off or crack easily if too much force was applied to open them, however, this issue would not stop me from buying again or from referral. With the seat well positioned and bolts tightened, I don't expect to need to play around with those hinge covers any time soon. Instructiions for the uninitiated were a bit sparse, but it's not rocket science. Nice feature to have the plastic/silicone(?) thin pads to place under the hinges. They probably go a long way towards keeping the seat in place. It's been in use for a few weeks now and we're still thrilled with it. I really mean thrilled - who knew? - and the old toilet looks brand new!After a year, I threw it out. Toilet seat moves even after securing it tightly - the bumpers don't keep it in place. Moved so much it bumpers regularly slid off the toilet bowl. Very annoying. Upon trying to tighten it the screw cap easily broke. Purchased a KOHLER K-4636-0, already much happier.","[""HIGH QUALITY: ergonomically contoured heavy duty molded polypropylene shell over wood core which won’t crack, chip, peel, flake, dent, flatten, bend or fade like other wood seats"",""STABLE / NO WIGGLE: impact absorbing heavy duty hinges (with corrosion-free hardware) and integrally-molded, permanent and sanitary color-keyed bumpers, secures seat into place"",""SANITARY: non-porous, scratch resistant high-gloss finish that won’t stain or discolor"",""SUPERIOR FIT / EASY TO INSTALL: easy to install and fits on all regular elongated toilet bowls including Kohler, American Standard, TOTO and many more"",""MADE IN THE USA – Centoco’s molded wood toilet seats are proudly made in the USA""]"

IOGear GCS1942 DisplayPort KVM.  My previous setup was a pair of 27"" WQHD monitors with DVI-D inputs, and  used an older IOGear DIV-D KVM which is also a dual-view KVM.  I can then run two computers with dual monitors.So, I tried FOUR other KVM's, and had issues all around.  Issues like the monitors ""forgetting"" window locations, monitors powering down, monitors not being recognized, proper resolutions and refresh rates not being recognizable, poor video quality, and having to try adapters to connect everything.  I spent DAYS messing with settings, drivers, adapters, resetting everything, clean installing everything ... what a hassle.  I returned them all.Due to the reliability of my old IOGear KVM, which is easily 10 years old, I decided to suck it up and spend the $433 for this new version.  Long story short, this KVM is worth every penny!!!Computers:*  Custom PC with GTX-970 which has a single DisplayPort and single HDMI output.  I had to buy an active adapter for my GTX-970's HDMI port.* A 2019 Dell laptop for work, with a USB-C Dell D6000 docking port, with two DisplayPort outputs.Results:YES, I WOULD BUY THIS AGAIN even though it was $433 - it is worth every penny.PROS:* Very good quality, just like my old IOGear KVM.  Big metal housing, clearly labelled ports, easy to use.* 4 DisplayPort cables included!  All you need are the DP cables to your monitors.* Proper support of 4K 60Hz resolutions, which looks flawless on my LG 32"" 4K monitors.* Familiar (at least for me) hotkey operation, the same as my old IOGear KVM.  Just press [scroll lock][scroll lock][enter] and you switch to the next PC.* This KVM supports the ""monitor is powered on"" protocol when disconnected.  This is VERY important - it means that when you switch from one PC to the next, and then come back, all your windows are in the same place, the resolution is the same, and it's PERFECT.* Supports wireless keyboard and mouse.  Do NOT believe the IOGear support folks who say you need a wired keyboard or their IOGear keyboard.  I am using an HP wireless keyboard and mouse, which is 5-6 years old, and I simply plugged the wireless USB nubs into the appropriate ports on the back of the KVM.  If you plug them into the ""standard"" USB port, then it will NOT work, so pay attention!CONS:* Switching PC's takes about 2-3 seconds, instead of the 1-2 seconds of my old KVM.  Horrors!  LOL.  :)* It is pretty big, so check the measurements.  I put mine on a shelf behind my monitors so I don't see it and don't care.* The cables are only 4' or 5' long.  Adding an extra foot or two length would have been helpful for me, but that is most because I have an antique desk and have to run the cables out my PC, under the back wall, then 4' up to the top or a raised shelf on the back.* It's $433!  I hate paying that much money, but then again my last one lasted 10+ years and I use it every day for work.  Plus, this works FLAWLESSLY.  I figure it's worth it.","[""Share 2 computers using one keyboard, Mouse, and HD monitor"",""Convenient switching by pushbutton, hotkeys, or 3-button wired USB mouse"",""1080P HD resolution; power on detection; firmware upgradeable"",""EDID support on Direct HDMI connection"",""Expand USB 2. 0 peripheral sharing via mouse Port with a powered USB hub"",""Backed by IOGEAR's 3-year and free lifetime technical support"",""Digital Audio support, Mac and sun keyboard support"",""Hdcp compliant, plug-n-play; no software required"",""Multi OS platform support, Works with game consoles"",""Includes 2. 1 Stereo sound and microphone support""]"

The seal is secure, clean-up is a cinch, they stack securely, they're durable, and they're comfortable to tote.  If you use them only occasionally, the tops can be staked separately from the bottoms to save space.True story: I was delivering a fresh strawberry pie and stumbled.  The pie carrier landed on its side and rolled about four or five meters on its side.  I was able to save the pie (it was for a church social, not for sale) with a little strategically piped whipped cream and no one was the wiser.  Had the carried not been secure, it would have been ""Bye-bye, Strawberry Pie""!It's a considerable savings to purchase four at a time, but they make great gifts for bakers if four is too much for you.  Also, I find them great for storage during the Christmas Season.  The seal is quite occlusive.  I use them to store CHristollen and Fruitcakes among other products.If I sound a bit hard sell on this item, it's because I've had such great success with it.

So now I spent money to have laminated work for them to destroy instead of making my own.Students loved this interactive resource. We had a lot of fun using this resource in Spanish 1 at the high school level. I used it to have students read and sequence story.

These jeans sit below the waist with a slim fit from hip to ankle. Made with +Levi's Flex: Our most advanced stretch technology engineered to deliver maximum flex and optimum comfort. Cut close to the body, the 511 Slim is a great alternative to the skinny jeans. More than 140 years after inventing the blue jean, one thing is clear: Levi’s clothes are loved by the people who wear them - from presidents to movie stars, farmers to fashion icons, entrepreneurs to the everyman.

Some have been 100% cotton and no stretch and others with just a bit of elastane. The ones with elastane are a bit lighter weight than the 100% cotton and they don't compare to the Japanese heritage jeans. They also don't cost nearly as much. Over the past five years I have found that the elastane is just as durable for everyday wear as the 100% cotton. Some of my Levi's are distressed and some are not. Most pairs are slim tapered, but I do have a couple pairs that are boot cut. In general, the slim tapered fit my body the best. The others can start looking like dad jeans in the calves.I bought my first pair of Blue Mekong Light jeans recently. As expected they came distressed. As soon as I put them on, my wife loved the look of them. The tapered legs fit great over short boots and look fine with sneakers. The distressed look was just what I was hoping for. The material is soft like well worn jeans should feel. I liked them so much that I ordered a second pair a week later. Both pairs look identical in every way and fit the same way. Perhaps both pairs were from the same lot, none the less, I was surprised at how identical they look and fit. The fading is very nicely done and doesn't have the typical striping on the thighs near the front pockets that you ordinarily see. My preference is to have the fading look natural as if I've worn these to the point where they are distressed.Most days I either wear blue or black 511 jeans.

The unit connects directly to a cold water source, which fills the tank and is heated with an electric heating element to the desired temperature until it's ready to be used. The water is released when a faucet or fixture is opened. What applications are point-of-use electric water heaters best for? Designed for single applications and small load requirements, these water heaters are commonly located under sinks, in small apartments, and in additions like side rooms and garages. What type of point-of-use electric water heater should I buy? Mini-tank water heaters preheat a small amount of reserved water until it's ready to be used. Tankless water heaters heat water on demand as it travels through electrical heating elements within the unit. What will happen if I connected this water heater to my hot water line? The cold water in the line will flow into the tank first and mix with the hot water there. The mini tank water heater will turn on heating until the hot water from your main water heater eventually reaches the mini tank Can this mini tank water heater be used for shower? A mini-tank water heater is not intended to service a shower because it requires a larger flow from 1.5gpm to 2.5gpm, while these mini tank capacity range from 1.3 gallons, 2.5 gallons and 4 gallons, to max 6.5 gallons.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Plumbing"",""Water Heaters & Parts"",""Water Heaters""]",thermomate,Tools & Home Improvement,"no manual. zip. zero. nada. nyet. installed correctly but no manual on how to set it up, etc. But once we found some youtuber that did this, it ran perfectly.

NIGHT PHOTOS: Four powerful LED lights and automatic infrared exposure provide up to 80’ of night illumination. SETTING UP YOUR LINK-MICRO-LTE CELLULAR TRAIL CAMERA         Choose a power source (SOLD SEPARATELY) We recommend using the SPYPOINT #LIT-10 rechargeable lithium battery pack, sold separately. For AA batteries, unlock the latch and open the LINK-MICRO-LTE door. Remove the battery compartment by grasping it by the 2 small notches on the side and pulling it out. Insert brand new AA batteries into the battery holder being careful to follow the polarity (+) and (-) indications. Place the battery holder back into the battery compartment. Remove the antenna mount and point the antenna in the desired direction. Format and install the microSD card (SOLD SEPARATELY) Before inserting the microSD card into your camera, it must be formatted by a computer to ensure proper operations. Once the card is formatted, make sure the camera is turned OFF. Find the microSD card slot located on the left, above the battery compartment. Insert the card into the slot with the metal contacts facing down. The card is inserted correctly when a click is heard. Activate the camera and release the antenna Activate the camera on the SPYPOINT website or app using the activation code located inside the LINK-MICRO-LTE's battery compartment, then configure the camera's settings. Remove the antenna mount to adjust the antenna during installation. Install and start the camera Choose a location for your camera and install it using the installation strap (included). Adjust the height of the camera to aim for the subject's mid-body. Avoid leaves, branches or tall grass in front of the camera as this can trigger motion detection resulting in blank photos. Follow the checklist on the inside of the camera's door to start the device. TROUBLESHOOTING The camera is not receiving a cellular signal. Verify the coverage area of the cellular network to make sure it reaches your area. Move your device to other locations to search for a stronger signal. Turn the device OFF and ON between the attempts. Make sure the antenna is installed properly (securely screwed down). Use the long range cellular antenna #CA-01 if necessary (sold separately). The camera is no longer responding. Make sure the batteries are sufficiently charged. NOTE: to verify the charge level, go to the STATUS section of your app and verify the battery % displayed. Don’t forget that the indicated status is from the last transfer. Also, when turning on the camera, if the status light flashes red quickly, it indicates that the battery’s charge is low. Turn the camera OFF and ON again. Remove and re-insert the battery compartment in the camera. From the app, reset the device to its original state. Perform the latest firmware update. The camera doesn't take pictures. Make sure the camera is turned ON. If it is not already done, remove the protective sticker on the detection lens of your camera. Format the microSD card. Do not choose the “Quick format” option. In your app, in your configurations, verify the operating periods you selected. Make sure the camera is not outside the operating periods. If none of the previous solutions works, reset the camera and the settings. The camera is not transmitting photos. Verify if the signal strength received by your device is sufficient. Make sure you have not reached the photo limit of your cellular plan. Verify if there is a message in the Photo section of your app: you will receive a notification if your camera is active, but no motion was detected. In those conditions, it is normal that your microSD card and your app did not receive new photos. Note that photos older than 7 days won’t be transferred. How to distinguish between “taking pictures” and “transmitting pictures” from your camera to your app: they are two distinct camera functions. If your microSD card contains photos, the camera has no problem taking photos. If your microSD card is empty (doesn’t contain photos), put it back in the camera and reboot your camera. Make a movement in front of the camera for it to take a photo. If there are still no photos on your microSD card, there is an issue with taking photos. If one or many photos are added to your microSD card once you have moved in front of your camera, after turning the camera off and on again, it should transfer them to your app in the next 15 minutes at most. Otherwise, there is an issue with photo transmission. The batteries are draining fast. The following configurations of your camera affect power consumption: delay between shots, multi-shots, detection sensibility, transfer frequency, and photo quality. If possible, choose less power-consuming options to optimize the life of your batteries. TROUBLESHOOTING The camera is not receiving a cellular signal. Verify the coverage area of the cellular network to make sure it reaches your area. Move your device to other locations to search for a stronger signal.

If your microSD card contains photos, the camera has no problem taking photos. If your microSD card is empty (doesn’t contain photos), put it back in the camera and reboot your camera. Make a movement in front of the camera for it to take a photo. If there are still no photos on your microSD card, there is an issue with taking photos. If one or many photos are added to your microSD card once you have moved in front of your camera, after turning the camera off and on again, it should transfer them to your app in the next 15 minutes at most. Otherwise, there is an issue with photo transmission. The batteries are draining fast. The following configurations of your camera affect power consumption: delay between shots, multi-shots, detection sensibility, transfer frequency, and photo quality. If possible, choose less power-consuming options to optimize the life of your batteries.

The first drop the spring for the lid to open on its own, popped out - but no biggie - everything still worked fine. It fell off a work table when someone moved her stuff out of the way not realizing they were pushing her player too. The 2nd time it fell, the little hook of the latch on the door broke off. I tried to fix it, being it wasn't covered in the warranty, but because of the type of plastic it is it wouldn't adhere back together. Either that or there were minute pieces missing. I started looking for another one - but this seems to be the only brand, that has anti-skip, drop, and other great features for a person who seems to be hard on her electronics. However the price jumped up tremendously since we had last bought it. Plus one of the battery springs had corroded & we're not sure why that happened. Really puzzling there being the batteries weren't corroded or any other parts.Recently (March 2023),i was looking at them again and saw that the price had been reduced - most likely because the company has a newer model now. But then I saw that Amazon warehouse was selling or rather reselling this at a lower price, ""claiming"" that the product was like new - in working condition. That the packaging may be open. So being I have had good results previously with products being remanufactured or fixed/repaired for reselling I took the chance... However, I cannot recommend Amazon's employees for thoroughly checking a product to see if it actually works as it should.The product turns on, the CD mechanism appears to work - but we couldn't find my sister's cds at the time to see if it actually plays. The radio switch worked - However... & this is a BIG however, it wouldn't tune to other stations. It was literally stuck on one station.I ended up removing the radio board from the newer unit & replacing it with the one my sister had in hers. Due to my experience with building & fixing computers, I was able to finally give her a working product. At least until we find her little case of CDs.Shame on Amazon's employees for not thoroughly checking this player. I feel they owe me a refund, or owe me for actually fixing what they should have! Or as my parents said - hire me to thoroughly check & fix these little personal CD & FM radio players! 😂My sister was looking for a cd player that she could use at home with her headphones. She has a boom box that has one but the outlet does not work on it and she does not have much space on her desk. This was the perfect answer. She loves it as it works well and plays all her Discs with music. The only reason there are 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the batteries don't last very long, and it's not like she uses it hours on end. So she constantly needs batteries. If they could make it use less energy that would give 5 stars. The price was affordable for myself, and I am hoping that isn't the reason for battery consumption.","[""Portable Cd Player And Radio With Earbuds"",""Requires 2 Aa Batteries (Not Included)"",""62 Second Anti-Skip Protection For Cds - Not Intended For Consistent Running Or Jogging"",""Analog Volume Control.

These bath tissue rolls have a high sheet count so staff spend less time on refill checks. Traditional bath tissue can be clunky to carry, but this commercial toilet paper comes in an Easy Handling Carry Box that makes it a breeze to transport and recycle.Advantages at a glance: + Individually wrapped rolls improve hygiene + High-capacity rolls + Bath tissue breaks up rapidly + Easy Handling Carry Box.","[""Health & Household"",""Household Supplies"",""Tissues, Toilet Paper & Sprays"",""Toilet Paper""]",‏  ‎ Essity,,"Our family of four buys one of these case boxes about once a year. Over the past several years we've tried similar papers from Scott, Envision, and Tork. I think we're on our third case of this product and it's been my favorite.The reason to buy these bulk cases of recycled paper is not because it's the softest thing out there, it's for the peace of mind. First, it cuts down on the frequency of the concern that you might not have a roll of paper when you need it, compared to buying the supermarket 8 or 12-packs. And second, being made of 100% recycled paper, you don't have to think about virgin boreal timber being felled to service your nether regions. (And there is no plastic anywhere in this case.)The other brands cover these merits just fine, of course. The reason this product is my favorite is that the rolls seem to have the fewest problems with separation of the plies, mis-alignment of the sheet perforations, and overuse of whatever adhesive sticks down the end of the roll. I occasionally get a Tork roll with one of these issues, but seems to be much less than in the others we've tried. And the softness here is the same or better than the other brands.I really don't understand the adhesive use on these bulk papers. Sometimes there is so much at the start of a roll that I end up tearing off about 20 feet trying to get going. Each roll is individually wrapped in paper, so I'm not even sure why gluing is required.Stock up ... may be another shortage...yea rightThis is a soft and thick double sheet TP, I've tried many brands of retail store brands and for the price this beats them all. After using several rolls I notice on some that the tear line on the sheets are not in alignment on a fresh roll for many sheets. The paper I received must be a reject I reduced the stars to 3 because of the tear line issue and having to waste many sheets that will not tear correctly.I have never ordered a large quantity of toilet paper like this before. Corona virus had caused all the stores to be sold out and I was running into the same thing on Amazon. Then I stumbled on this Tork product and it was available. 96 rolls I thought might be overkill but for the cost it was hard to pass up. It was delivered in two days. I am very surprised by the quality of this product. Much stronger than most of the popular store brands. Not sure, at this point, how long the stores will continue to be sold out of toilet paper but I am so glad I made this purchase.Discovered this TP in a hotel and was so impressed I jotted down the manufacturer and researched. Bought one case two years ago, and now ordering another. Only 2-ply but strong! Plumbing friendly. Thin, strong paper means you can do multiple fold-overs without worrying you're going to clog the bowl with paper. It's not cushy soft but it's not rough. It cleans without leaving lint debris. So strong that even at 2-ply, it doesn't break through at (ahem) the critical stage of wiping. Oh and each roll is packaged in tissue thin cotton wrapper. No plastic!! *note: at the beginning of each roll, don't be alarmed by the plies separating and looking wispy; this is just with the first five or so sheetsPerfect if you need something in bulk for large families that won’t clog up the toilet or septic tank. Not exactly the lowest-grade that you can buy either. It’s not quite soft enough for me, but just fine for my husband and kids. This saves us quite a bit of money and lasts easily 2-3 months (and that’s with 10 people using it.) Compared to other paper in the same catagory, it’s better than most.Good product for a business not for home. I'm spoiled so I have to take that in to consideration. The rolls are typical for businesses. Even though they are 2ply they are not very soft. So when my name brand goes on sale I buy that and give the the same amount of these to my brother!Me and my family love it it has lasted so far 2 months and I am still not out yet and don't believe I will for another 2 or so weeks and this is for a family of 9, I think it's a great value it's two ply and you get a lot for less money so it's a win win. I would and have recommended it to everyone I know.Update may 5th 2017:Still use it and order it and still love it great value last along time and still cheaper then getting it from down town,when you need a lot of toilet paper and use a lot this is the one to get if u want to spend more money get less toilet paper don't look here because this will save you money and give you more toilet paper and it don't fill like sand paper.All good just a little on the rougher side, but still gets the job done !!!!Pretty good tp. Just having that many in one box is worth it.","[""Improve hygiene and cleanliness with individually wrapped bath tissue rolls."",""A simple and easy-to-use solution for low-traffic restrooms in any industry."",""Save staff time thanks to a high sheet count, which reduces refill maintenance."",""Enhance guest experience with attractive embossing that improves bulk and softness."",""96 rolls, 500 sheets each, 2 ply.

The straps are soft and comfortable, not very strong though and I can tell they will be flimsy over time, faster than the more expensive bras I own. But very comfortable. The cup shape is good, not too squeezed together or rounded, so in my opinion it looks nicer under a sweater.

Brand Story By","[""Health & Household"",""Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements"",""Herbal Supplements"",""Ginkgo Biloba""]",‏  ‎ Nature's Bounty,,"I really recommend these for anyone who is battling depression or trauma. Of course, if you have a much serious case, please seek help, but here is my story about these magic pills.I've been buying these for years now, however I never used them consistently until recently. I honestly thought they could have been more of a placebo affect until I started taking it more often.I have really bad episodes of depression. To the point I can't move or function because I'm constantly annoyed with everything and myself for feeling so down. I would feel the depression set in and then I just start to spiral until I can calm myself down or go into a panic attack.Again, I didn't really understand that they were working until recently because I got married. Whenever I start to feel down I always tell my husband. I do this more to seek comfort, but my husband started to immediately tell me to ""take my medicine"" every time I would tell him that I'm starting to feel down. So, I would go take it and then he would comfort me and a little later I would feel better. Still, I thought it was more because he comforted me instead of the suppliment.Recently I have been taking it every time I start to feel down. It's only twice a day, but I found that it works like my schedule does. I wake up in the morning (I am not a morning person), I immediately take it. Give it a little bit and I'm okay. Around, 8pm I start to feel down again. I feel myself starting to spiral, so I go take one.It wasn't until I started taking it then that I realized that it was working. No one is there to comfort me, nothing at work is making anything better to my mood, just this suppliment.I wish I could express more on how much this helps me. It's not ""oh I'm feeling sad"" it's making me and helping me not fight myself. I am in no way a medical expert or mental health professional. But, this has changed my life. This is sincerely coming from someone who has violent panic attacks from childhood trauma (that I'm not going to go into). I definitely have a lot more steps to take to help myself mentally, but without this suppliment I couldn't find a place to start.Take this when you're down or just to give support to your most important organ in your body. It can't hurt to try. Take care of yourself and give yourself the chance to get better, even if you don't believe it's possible.I researched ginkgo biloba for hours and decided to try this brand. When it arrived I started taking it not expecting any affect, but right away I noticed my thinking felt so much clearer. I encouraged my husband, adult daughter and son to try and they too said it made a difference.Fast forward to my husband finding a ginkgo supplement at Costco and buying it thinking we could save a little money. We all tried it. Nothing happened. I tried taking two at a time and barely anything. I went back to Amazon and bought these again because these actually work.Whatever formula these have, it's really good. Don't waste your time or money on another supplement. I just wish there was an option to subscribe for monthly shipments.Does the job!Easy to swallow, I keep this on hand for my husband and I.Good supplements for the price.I have used it for many years.I always buy these exact brand and love the mental focus with any side effects as in jiggers or insomnia which higher doses may occur. Trusted buyer here :)HelpfulI have to try the item for at least for two months to give comments on the quality and its effect on healthNot a good product, will leave you with upset stomach.I use this for my mom and it helps.Global mart is the best seller for imported goods in IndiaOriginal products from US and great price.","[""GINKGO BILOBA SUPPLEMENT: Nature's Bounty's Ginkgo Biloba 120 mg standardized extract may help maintain healthy circulation & may help support mental alertness & healthy brain function, perfect for occasional mild memory problems associated with aging"",""MENTAL ALERTNESS & MEMORY: Used in China in the 15th century for its healthy properties, Ginkgo Biloba may help support healthy brain function, mental alertness and support memory, especially occasional mild memory problems associated with aging.Sodium free"",""MINERALS FOR MOOD: Nature’s Bounty Calcium-Magnesium and can support a calm, relaxed mood"",""NATURE'S BOUNTY FOR A HEALTHY LIFE: At Nature's Bounty, we want to help you maintain wellness at every stage of life & carry a range of vitamins & supplements including prenatal vitamins, mood support, joint support & supplements for healthy aging"",""GUARANTEED QUALITY: Nature's Bounty nutritional supplements meet high quality standards Try them if you've enjoyed supplements from Garden of Life, Vitafusion, Rainbow Light, Centrum, Alive, Solgar, Nordic Naturals, or Nature Made""]"

Tape the small parts to the frames please!For the price these are probably OK racks, a little flimsy. I'd like to see the connections of the frame parts was a bit more solid. Two of the cage nuts were not threaded and I was out of other ones, so contacted TGripp-Lite customer support to see if they could just drop me some replacement in the email. Simple request. Their support is slow and pathetic. Contacted by two different folks who seem confused what a cage nut is. What they heck are those folks doing in Tripp Lite support. Makes me think I won't buy more from them, I'd hate to be dealing with a complex support issue. I gave up and ordered 100 Acinfinity 6mm cage nuts and screws from Amazon, and they are better made, and easier to install than the ones supplied by Tripp Lite.Great value for a mini rack Easy to assemble but fits almost anywhere, anywhere you need a rack for cables, network gear, sound gear this is your pieceThis rack is a fairly decent piece of equipment but it really is very simple. I bought this to hold all my Cisco equipment that I used to study for certification exams. Completely unloaded, the rack seems a little flimsy but once you throw a couple of units in it seems to become more sturdy. I wouldn't put anything that is exceptionally heavy on it or more than one rack unit though unless you ground it to a sturdier base.I felt like the rack might topple if I put my HP rack mount server on it. This rack might work well for a SOHO environment that needs some rack equipment, but without any temperature monitoring or control I'd be cautious about loading this thing up and letting it go.Assembly was a little bit of a headache, but once you figure out that 95% of the pieces in the box are to secure devices, it gets a little easier. I keep about 8 1-Unit devices on it with a rack mount power strip in the middle and it is doing quite well. The rack gets hot if I power on all the devices, but just casual equipment tests work great.The rack seems well-built however the hardware bolts seem very undersized. I'm sure this is by design to accommodate adjustment but it seems a bit excessive. I will definitely upgrade the bolt size. Outside of that I think it's a great product for the price.Fantastic rack, especially for the price. It could stand to be a little more stable, but that's easily enough rectified. As it is with just a patch panel and 1 small switch, it's already doing quite well. Assembly was quick and easy (though instructions could have been a smidgeon more clear, but it wasn't rocket science so doable enough without).The numbered indications and markings for each U of space is quite wonderful and handy. The rack was actually a little shorter than I was expecting. i'm sure it's the right size, but for some reason I was expecting it to be at least a few inches taller. ALl in all, easy setup.The packaging was a little worn, but otherwise in good condition with nothing sticking out. All parts were intact and inside the box, with nary a scuff or scratch on the unit. Absolutely amazing product and experience.(this review is for the 13U size)I bought this rack and a 1U shelf to organize my home networking gear. It's pretty much perfect for the job. My only (tiny) issue is that it's about an inch too tall to fit under the table where I had planned to put it, but that's an easy thing to work around.I was a little surprised that the box included both 12-24 and 10-30 screws. The rack is, of course, threaded for 12-24, so I don't see any reason for the 10-30 to be included.Worked great for my home network lab needs. I only used about 15U slots on it but the rack still wanted to tip backwards from the weight distribution. For best results you'll want to mount this to the floor or on a wider platform with casters to move around if that's your need. Assembly took about 20min.TIP: Don't completely tighten all corners until you've racked some equipment. I thought I had the rack completely square but some of the holes didn't line up with the router ears I had so I had to loosen up the corners and install the router and then go back and tighten up the 2post rack.Used this for a home network setup. In addition to the 48-port switch and power supply, I threw some 1U and 2U shelves on it, and it works like a charm.For the price, you cannot get a better deal!I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this floor standing 45U rack. Easy to setup, and holds a lot of weight without tipping.Es muy pequeño, está inclinado hacia atrás hay que tomar en cuenta eso ya que si se pone un monitor o algún equipo fácilmente deslizable se puede caer.El Rack es de excelente calidad para equipar un cuarto de telecomunicaciones sencillo pero adecuado para una oficina mediana. Cuenta con toda la tornilleria para instalar los accesorios.Only the 2 posts are in aluminium.

"ECLIPSE Hair Fibers Light Brown for Thinning Hair for Women & Men to Conceal Hair Loss in 15 Seconds - 100% Undetectable Hair Building Fibers, 30g",Eclipse Instant Hair Filler,"Are you concerned about thinning hair? Do you feel like you have to style your hair a certain way to cover up those areas? Well, worry no more!

You'll see instant results that are undetectable from just inches away. So no one will know you're using hair fibers to conceal your thinning areas. Eclipse Hair Fibers are made of natural keratin fibers that bond securely to your existing hair. They're also completely safe and gentle on your scalp and won't cause any irritation. And because they're made of natural fibers, they'll resist wind, rain, and perspiration for long-lasting results. So if you're looking for a way to get the appearance of thicker, fuller hair quickly and easily, then Eclipse Hair Fibers are the perfect solution for you! And because our Hair Fibers have been used by Hollywood Stylists and Barbers for the top celebrities, you can trust that they will give you the look you want. So don't wait any longer, try Eclipse Hair Fibers today!","[""Beauty & Personal Care"",""Hair Care"",""Hair Loss Products"",""Hair Building Fibers""]",‏  ‎ Beauty Group LLC,,"Excellent product easy to use and lasts. Solves a real problem.If you want a fuller head of hair for a photo, that will work. If that’s for a social event where no one will look closely, it should work fine. If you want to use it on a date, forget it! Imagine she run her hand over your hair and it comes out full of this rough powdery stuff! By the way, make sure you shampoo before going to bed or you will be grossed out by what you see on your pillow the next morning.OK, I'll be perfectly honest here and tell you that a couple of years ago I went through a stressful enough period that much of my hair seemed to acquire passports and immigrate to someone else's head… for real. Given that I have thin, fine hair and not a lot of it, it created some serious problems for me because being a woman with bald spots all over her head… is harder to deal with than I ever could have imagined.So I started doing homework. Lots of it. Research that clearly demonstrated that my problem is not unusual, not easy to manage and has no ""quick fix"" of any kind. But it can be managed successfully.I didn't want to go with Rogaine for women because there's just too much negative feedback on it and because once you start using the stack of chemicals it contains you can't ever go off of it again. Which led me to Surge Shampoo; a product with enough longitudinal studies to be able to verify that the inclusion of caffeine and other ingredients (pretty much all of them recognizable and natural) genuinely work on fine, thinning hair AND hair loss when applied topically.But I didn't stop there either. I strongly believe that supplements are enormously important additions for anyone who doesn't have a PERFECTLY balanced diet and honestly, I don't think there are many of those around… or at least many who will freely admit that they don't. So knowing what I do about vitamins, minerals and iron- (liquid form taken with vitamin C to make it easier for the body to absorb) I searched for something of that nature that would work on restoring and building new hair follicles to use in conjunction with the shampoo. As it turns out, there is a vitamin that contains a high enough Keratin content (among many other ingredients some of which are found primarily in the B-category) to aid not only in stimulating hair growth but also to increase both strength and thickness of finger & toenails as well.However, all of those things take time and I was still going to have enough scalp showing to make me look like a virtually hairless cat (whatever the breed that does that is). So the gal who colors my hair (counter-intuitive I know but I NEED my hair to be damaged in order to give it more fullness and body) shook enough Eclipse onto my scalp/ bald-spots to actually cover them almost completely. My stylist says that most of it's success lies in the fact that, like a good ""foundation"" for the face, it actually acts to eliminate the shine that made my scalp so visible. But the fibers that act to both ""fill and cover"" those spots are colored for a reason: to match your hair color and darken your scalp while also eliminating the ""shiny"" on your skin-covered skull. Those fibers attach themselves to both the ""baby fuzz"" hair follicles AND to the skin in between them. So although I'm now using less of it, I NEEDED that coverage enough that, at the time, I was going through almost a full container a month waiting for the vitamins and the Surge to start working their magic as well.Oh, and for what it's worth, the fibers in Eclipse will stay on your head until the next wash. Whether it's every day, every other day or once every 3-4 days. Is it worth it? Absolutely! Just ask that previously almost bald lady (that would be me folks) who is now only using it for selective ""spot coverage"" and whose little bottles of magic are now lasting for months PLURAL instead of just every 4 weeks or so. Honestly, if my colorist hadn't had samples to use on my head to demonstrate the advantages of this little miracle in a bottle!works wellI have been using Eclipse Hair Fibers and refill fibers that I fill up the Eclipse bottle. Buying refill fibers is a cost effective method to save money. Fibers are easy to use, just lightly sprinkle the fibers on the thin areas of your head. I also use ISOS after the fibers. By using the ISOS, I don’t have to tease my hair, just lift the hair, style, then spray. I am so thankful I learned about the fibers. When you buy the Eclipse bottle, the lid is removable, and use the refill fibers to refill the bottle. I definitely recommend fibers if your hair is thin, and you can see your scalp. Amazing product!!!!This covers so well. This price is the best around for this product.My hairdresser turned my on to this. I feel like I have a little thinning on top and after you do your hair, just shake the can and sprinkle a little on your head. It masks the thinning a little. It seems to put a color filler in (like power) but so lightly that you can’t tell. Love it.I've used Eclipse now for several months and am very pleased with it. It really fills in and makes my hair look better! My scalp can become a little itchy at the end of the day and I just brush the product out. I highly recommend it.They a false advertising as the description says a 30g bottle however they only sent 15g. If I knew they were only going to send 15g I would’ve got it from somewhere else for cheaper. Poor advertisingI just wish I’d started using this product years ago! It looks so natural and has given me such confidenceGreat productLove this!

We are not huge but we are growing, 8-10 states last I checked. I found these cables and showed my boss. He agreed it was a great deal! By the time we buy cable, connectors, and pay a tech, it will cost way more than these cables. We did the math and it was almost a dollar for 2 RJ45s plus the cable (that depends on the footage) and then a tech to build and test.

I returned it and decided to order a bigger one and went with this light instead and I’m so glad I did. This light is so much brighter than the first one I bought. It’s actually significantly brighter than using two 1500 lumen work lights. It comes with an adjustable stand that’s well built, durable, and extends up to the ceiling. It also includes a mount for your phone or camera. This is extremely helpful because of how cluttered it becomes using both a tripod for the camera as well as a tripod for the light. It’s hard to get a good shot with both of them essentially needing to be in the same place. There’s also a Bluetooth shutter remote for your smartphone which feels cheaply made compared to the other accessories that are included, but works fine for now. The value of the light and stand is well worth the price and all the added accessories give you everything you need to start using the light right away. One thing I’ve added to the setup is using a digital av adapter connected from my iPhone to a monitor so I can see what I’m shooting while using the higher quality rear camera on my iphone, as opposed to the selfie camera. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a quality ring light for a great value. I’d also highly suggest spending a little more money on this model and skipping the cheaper light.

I’ve always been impressed with Valeo wiper blades, and these have lived up to the expectation as well. Best blades around in my opinion.Easiest wipers I have ever installed. Haven’t tested in the rain yet.After studying online, I found the correct number for my Sprinter is VM423 for the 26/24"" wiper set. They fit perfectly with simple installation.This listing shows only one heading regardless of model number chosen, but you may trust that your purchase is the correct length or lengths. Research what is required, then order with confidence. Best price online!I liked that the windshield wipers where as close to an OEM part as you could get.Direct fit on my F25 X3. No adapters, fits as oem. Seems to function as well, works quietly.A sensible replacement for the OEM blades which seem unreasonably priced.Wipes very clean like OEM. No streaks, smooth wipe.Excellent fit. Right thickness and effective water displacement.""Exact Match OE: Original factory quality wiper beam blade set""Completely untrue. Time will tell if will work well, but they are nothing like the BMW OEM parts they replaced. Much thinner and completely different in many regards. I bought them thinking that Valeo was the OEM supplier (maybe they are?) and they would be the same parts branded differently. They fit, but that's about it. Don't make the same mistake.AP Motor Store sent the exact genuine Valeo wiper blades as ordered. This item is compatible with a 2012 BMW X3 F25 XDrive30D. For owners of this vehicle it takes only a few minutes to replace the wiper blade. Sit in the car and close the door, press the start button once to wake up the car and press again to put the car to sleep, then lift up the wiper stork for 3-4 seconds. The wipers will lift up to allow you to change them. Put the wiper blades in a T shape position and pull the wiper towards you, it is only held on by a small black rod that is loose, replace both wipers then press the wiper stork done to bring the wipers back downI usually only fit OE wiper blades to my car, but having read a few user comments about these on Briskoda (Forum), I decided that £10.99 including postage (as they were at the time) was worth the risk. They arrived quickly and were well packed, fitted onto the wiper arms without having to resort to selecting appropriate fittings from a pack in the box and seem to work very well. Time will tell how long they last, but as the last pair of OE blades I bought for my Skoda Octavia were over £35.00 from the dealer, I could by three sets of these and still be better off!!Go on . . . . . try them. I think you will be surprised how good they are.Been buying these for the last three or so years for my Octavia. Tried more expensive ones like bosch and a few others but the Silencios have performed the best and are much cheaper. The latest I paid was £11.46 for a pair (Jan 19).No streaks, squeaks or judder. Just smooth silent clearing of the windscreen.Easy to fit: lift wiper arm, turn blade 90 degrees and slide off, slide new one onto the pin then lower back down onto windscreen. Takes 10 seconds. None of that faffing around with clips and stuff.Much quieter wipers than the Bosch ones but are very easily damaged in cold weather. Had mine 4 months and the rubber is already pitted and leaving streaks on the windscreen after being switched on accidentally when the screen was frosted up. I'll buy again as they are cheap enough and very quiet but be aware of this.5 stars are for the seller. Very quick delivery. No problems.My wife attempted to buy other ""cheaper"" versions from various sites that were to be honest- substandard for her C class AMGEN sport Coupe.

For long-term reliability, Ultra Touch includes a three-year limited product .","[""Electronics"",""Computers & Accessories"",""Data Storage"",""External Solid State Drives""]",‎SEAGATE,,"bought this due to review comparing it to other drives by same manufacturerHowever still find it unbearably slowNow honestly, moving gigabites in volume is a lot of bits to move, so ???? .... but it clearly is usable as 'back up storrage' only and NOT for 'live use' of anything beyond looking at a small sized jpg.I am not unhappy, if it holds up as Back up storrage, but will need to find additional solutionsThis is great! Copies quickly, a one MB folder was completely copied in a little over a minute! No problems at all.As noted in other reviews it worked right out of the pkg on my MacBook Pro w/o any formatting. Used solely to store my tens of thousands photos. Bottom gets pretty warm as it is a HDD & not an SSD. Write speed is slow but I knew that when I bought it for the price. Device side of cable appears proprietary (see photo). Didn't use any of the SW provided on the drive. Nameplate says made in Thailand in 2022.First I love the compact size and then the price for 2T is very good. It wasn't hard to set up with my MacBookPro. Once I went through the downloaded installer and was able to go to the Time Machine in my system preferences and check this as my preferred backup device. The first backup is a little over one hour but I have a lot to download so the time to do this is fine with me. I also liked the fact that it came with a USB-C adaptor so I didn't have to go to an Apple dongle. I have used G Drives in the past but the prices are extremely high now if all you are doing is backing up to your personal computer. I am not a tech savvy person but I didn't need any tech support to get this running.I can use it to secure my important documents.I am using this to back up photos and video clips to relieve brain space on my Mac. Of course, I have another of a different brand as well as extra backup. I had no problems formatting and was able to start dragging & dropping files immediately. Great price for 1TB and a good solution compared to the many, many flashdrives of every high-rated brand under the sun that has failed.It's a fine hard drive for the price, but I bought this because I thought it used a USB-C connection. instead, it's a proprietary connection leading to a USB-A...with an A to C adapter. That means one more thing to remember every time I want to connect this hard drive to a modern computer.I loved this thing since I got it at the tail end of 2019. I save all my important docs, pictures, emulators, etc on this drive. I do not use it for automated backup and I use a Miscrosoft Surface Book 2. My issue with this hard drive is sometimes it takes a while for it to load after putting in my password. The high probability of constantly troubleshooting and losing all of my precious data freaks me out. I can deal with unplugging and re-plugging once or twice to get it to work. Tonight I tried to get it to load for 3 hours, doing combinations of laptop restarts, unplugging and re-plugging, switching power cords, trying to use Toolkit to deactivate the password feature (that's where it always seems to freeze and stop responding). It seems like it doesn't stay powered on long enough through the loading process and just stops responding. I have not tried calling customer support yet as it's almost 23:00 EST as of this writing, but I may try tomorrow. If it is something that is easily fixed, I would love to give it 5 stars.UPDATE 2/22/21: I was finally able to disable password encryption and no issues! 4 stars only because I'm not sure if it will act up again when I re-enable it.Broken down and died after 1 week. I called Seagate, the told me it could happen because the drive is very sensitive!!! How can that be an excuse!! I lost all my data.The 1 star is for Amazon. Returned withought question.I have always used seagate hardrives in the past and I work with large files daily and this was a disappointment. Paid about $200 for the 1TB and i was expecting it to be pretty fast. I tried to transfer a 171GB file from my macbook pro (2019) to my SSD and it took nearly 45 mins!!!! I was also really disappointed with the USB-C adapter it came with, it feels cheap and was super loose and kept disconnecting easily from my macbook. Tried transferring a 10GB file from my husbands PC laptop, took 3mins and 12 seconds... Very disappointed. Now i have to spend more money and see if a USB-C to Micro-B cable would work for this instead or better yet return this and find a better hard drive!Great product BUT, if you have a Mac and are doing your backups in Time Machine, you should know that if you use this as your storage, you can ONLY store the Time Machine backups on it. Nothing else. This means you can't drag folders or add extra photos or anything like this.Also, it does take a bit of figuring out to format the disk to be compatible to do the Time Machine backups, but once that's done it works fine.This drive did not work out for me. It was defective for sure, it would disconnect and stop running while transferring large files. Eventually it was unreadable on two laptops, which it somehow manages to freeze the laptops and a reboot had to happen. I had a lot of data to transfer and was unable to finish. I was able to format the drive after several attempts so I can return it. I wouldn't recommend it for large data transfer.","[""ANDROID READY Easily manage phone content using the included Android app"",""UNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY: External drive includes a USB-A to USB-C adapter and an integrated USB cable for Windows and Mac* laptops *Reformatting may be required for use with Time Machine."",""COMPACT FABRIC SSD: Featuring a palm-sized, lightweight, fabric design, this portable SSD delivers high-speeds for streaming stored videos directly to a laptop and backing up on the go"",""ADOBE & MYLIO: Edit, manage, and share photos with a one-year complimentary subscription to Mylio Create and a two-month membership to Adobe CC Photography plan (not available in all countries)""]"

I'd love for my daughter to learn where each of the countries are in the world. However, the maps of the world are so tiny that they are worthless for trying to learn their location. I'm not even kidding or exaggerating or just needing bifocals or something. So disappointing. The pictures in Amazon are not even close to actual size. They're a lot bigger.Some of the stats are worthless educationally, but we saw that in other reviews so expected that a bit. However, we are very disappointed about the maps on the cards being unusable. At least these cards may get her familiar with the names of countries. If we play it. But she hasn't wanted to play it after the first time, so this seems like a bust.Hope they fix this sometime.I love these ""Top Trumps"" card games and grew up playing them with my brother. You always learn a little as you play. I think this one is particularly educational - the competitive categories are highest point, population, land area, Olympic medals and flight time from D.C. There's also a picture of the flag and some fun facts about each country on the cards. Did you know India has four times the population of the US in one third as much area? Highly recommend, great stocking stuffer.These card games are unfortunately named but they can be educational and engaging for the kids - the ""Countries"" version includes the information of 30 countries such as population, area, highest point, flight time from Washington DC and number of olympic medals won (probably as of 2014) and you win or lose cards by picking the strongest attribute of the card in hand and hoping it will best that of your opponent's.Keeps my son occupied and very happy! Really great game for a 7 yr old boy. It's amazing to me how much he now knows about countries of the world!This game is fun and durable. It’s also very convenient to bring along for long rides.Just like top trumps from my youth.Not dusty, the colour of the packing is excellent, the plastic is not cracked and the overall packaging is sealed. But the box is a bit smelly, not suitable for kids. The cards is fine.We have played several top trumps games. This one somehow has confusing categories. It does not get chosen too often.I think pretty much everyone, every age, likes Top Trumps.This version was a hit with the boys (11 and 13), especially as their dad was completely out of his comfort zone (I don't think I have ever seen him use an emoti!).Grandson learn plays same timeGreat item and can learn so much from each card too!Great game my child loves playing these and is learning while playing","[""Entertaining educational card game loved for bringing your favorite skyscrapers from around the world to life"",""Play Top Trumps anytime, anywhere, with as many people as you like"",""Find out the height of the Burj Khalifa, the number of floors in The Shard, and the year the CN Tower was built in this edition of Top Trumps - Skyscrapers"",""Easy-to-carry plastic case means there are no limits on gameplay"",""Prepare to outsmart your opponents, discover new and exciting facts and duel your way to becoming the Top Trump""]"
Camco Large RV Wheel Stop | Fits 26 to 30-inch Diameter Tires | Tire Spacing from 3 ½ to 5 ½-inches | Yellow (44622),Camco,"Camco's Large RV Wheel Stop is designed to help stop your trailer’s tandem tires from shifting, using just one piece of equipment. It fastens your tandem tires while you are parked or re-hitching. This Wheel Stop fits 26 to 30-inch diameter tires with a tire spacing from 3 ½ to 5 ½-inches. It installs easily between your tires and features raised ribs for increased traction and less slippage. Made of a lightweight, durable polymer construction with a rubber handle. Note: To determine tire spacing, measure between both tires from tread to tread at their closest point together. For recreation vehicles only. Camco makes quality products for RVing, boating, camping, towing, tailgating, and grilling that help you take your passion for the outdoors to the next level.","[""Automotive"",""RV Parts & Accessories"",""Exterior"",""Leveling & Stablilization"",""Levelers""]",‎Camco,,"Easy to use work's greatThe camper seems more stable with these in place and they are a quick install. Takes a bit more time than just putting chocks in place but worth it.Works greatWhy pay top dollar? These are very sturdy and well made and my RV has not moved one bit!Easy to install. Notice some increased stability. Not sure how much. But worth the price and i don't believe I put undue stress on axels usimg them.They will do for a cheaper set up. You will have to tighten them from time to time thou. Just make sure your strong enough to tighten them down. They work just fine.I run these on a Jayco Jayfeather X213. The tires are very close together and so I don't think the typical scissor style chocks would even work.These are awesome though. I usually boondock and, even on the most unlevel camping spots, the difference in stability using these is huge. The trailer barely ever moves. My wife used to get mad because just walking to the bathroom used to cause the whole trailer to shake and wake her up at night, but not anymore.I read several reviews that stated how it helped to minimize the feeling of movement but even after getting one for each side I feel it the same.Bought two of these in large (wish it came in a set). Used them on our 33’ travel trailer. The trailer has two large opposing slides. It is a fairly heavy trailer and doesn’t rock a lot from the start but these virtually eliminated any rocking that was there. In a lighter trailer, I could see why you would want to go with the heavy duty steel version at double the cost. If your trailer has a lot of movement, these may not be for you. If you want to shore up the last little bit of motion after you’re all set up... you can’t go wrong with these.Works great for my narrow wheel gap. I was using a x-chock before. But because my wheels are close together, and the design of my fenders, it made it very awkward to use and get a wrench in there. The Camco wheels chocks work much better. Simple, and no extra wrench to store. They are also light weight, and less clunky to store. Makes trailer solid as a rock. After tires cool from driving, it's a good idea to snug them up a bit. Easy to give the knob a quick twist versus finding the to wrench with the xchock.I bought these as an alternative to more expensive and heavy steel ones. I am very pleased at how much more solid and stable my travel trailer feels when parked. It almost eliminates all that shake and jiggle of the trailer caused by walking inside. I was concerned that being plastic they might be flimsy and lack durabilty. So far they are holding up well. Just resist the temptation to overtighten them and I'm sure they will last for many years.these things are great! they make it so much safer to hitch and unhitch the trailer because they prevent any movement as the tongue goes up and down. Also, when you're in the trailer it keeps things still so when others are walking around you don't feel the trailer moving/wiggling. They are way better and easier than the wheel chocks the slip in front of the tire.the threaded part should have been longer..it actually was hard to push between the tires..cause it was short the threaded bar...it said for tires between 26"" to 30"" which my are and the space between the tires 31//2"" to 51/2""which mine was...Please make the threaded bar another 1"" longer and it will work much better..thank you!","[""Helps Stop Trailer Movement: Stops your trailer’s tandem tires from shifting, using just one piece of equipment; Fastens your tandem tires while you are parked or re-hitching"",""Compatibility: Works with 26 to 30-inch diameter tires and fits tires spacing from 3 ½ to 5 ½-inches"",""Features: Raised ribs for increased traction and less slippage"",""Easy to Use: Installs easily between tires; Note: To determine tire spacing, measure between both tires from tread to tread at their closest point together"",""Durable Construction: Made of lightweight and durable polymer construction with a rubber handle""]"

This one is simple and straightforward. Super easy to assemble, and while I only really use the flat nozzle, having a second round one is nice.My only complaints are twofold: one, that there's no plunger. You want to get the air out when stuffing the tube, and there's no tool to do so. I use the kitchen aid meat grinder, and the plunger that comes with it is a little small for this tube, but works well enough. Two, there's no cleaning brush. It's a long, thin tube, filled with raw meat. It's a bit tough to clean. An issue with all jerky guns, but a brush would be nice.All in all though, for the money, it's great, and works as advertised.

I started with Vault X, which are good quality, but hold the cards rather loosely (note, I am single sleeving my cards before inserting them in the pages). I was not happy with how easily the cards fell out. I then tried DragonShield and was immediately disappointed with the quality, as many of the pages had permanent marks and the clear plastic itself was wavy and affected the appearance of the cards, not to mention how flimsy the pages were.Finally I tried BCW and I couldn't be more satisfied. The pages aren't quite as stiff/heavy as Vault X, however, they hold my single sleeves cards a little tighter, making it less likely that they fall out. They are also marginally smaller than the Vault X pages, so they fit better in my 3-ring binder. The clear plastic is smooth, not wavy like the Dragonshield.Overall very satisfied. I would recommend these pages with the BCW card sleeves as well as the Avery Ultralast 3-ring binder.","[""Accommodates 18 cards"",""Side loading prevents slipping and falling"",""Premium, double-sided, Archival-safe Polypropylene Pages will not harm cards"",""Attractive method to store and display cards""]"

I also like the look of 5 blades compared to 3. The remote is fully featured with 6 speeds, summer/winter modes, timers, and a special button named ""Natural Wind"" that when pressed quietly cycles the fan through different speeds randomly... which I find very enjoyable.Installing it was fairly easy, they've provided a hanger style bracket that once installed on ceiling the fan then just slides into it. There's a terminal block on the side of that hanger bracket that allows the house wiring to connect to the fan wiring without the need for wire nuts. After hanging the fan, I just plugged in 2 connectors and connected the ground wire... wiring done!The fan blades each attach with 3 screws, a few of the screws were tight all the way in from finish or debris in the threads. These all tightened just fine but needed just a bit of extra muscle. I had read a couple of reviews that complained about stripping screws, I did not have this problem.The covers are really nice and are super easy to move into place.When I first ran the fan it wobbled only on its highest speeds of 5 and 6. The included balancing kit worked very well and after 6 tries I had the fan perfectly balanced.I am super happy with this ceiling fan and looks great in the room.","[""MINIMALIST STYLE This 64-inch indoor ceiling fan has 5 powerful blades to make your home more comfortable; It offers a sleek, minimalistic design that blends into any modern environment.

"GU Energy Roctane Ultra Endurance Energy Gel, 24-Count, Cherry Lime",GU Energy,"GU Roctane Ultra Endurance Energy Gel is a high-intensity offering from GU, the original sports energy gel. Designed for extreme and long-duration endurance activities, GU Roctane Energy Gel comes in highly compact, portable, and calorie-dense packets that are loaded with carbohydrates that can be rapidly absorbed. Athletes performing at a high level for hours on end need more from their nutrition, which is why Roctane Energy Gel packs three-times the amino acids and twice the sodium as original GU Energy Gel. These ingredients boost Roctane's efforts to help decrease muscle damage, promote muscle repair, and maintain water balance. Each packet of GU Roctane Ultra Endurance Energy Gel contains 100 calories and 1425mg of amino acids.","[""Health & Household"",""Diet & Sports Nutrition"",""Endurance & Energy"",""Chews & Gels""]",‏  ‎ GU Energy Labs,‏  ‎ Unisex-adult,"I use these for cycling and for work and they are awesome for keeping me hydrated and safe during the dangerous heat we have had this summerLos empaques son muy comodo para llevar en el bolsillo a la hora del ejercicioThese are good when you are trying to manage how many calories you are ingesting on super long rides. These are easy on the stomach, and provide enough calories to supplement my liquid nutrition. They are really easy to carry and open while riding.I swear by the GU Roctane products to aid in my cycling. These help pick you up and have a kick of caffeine in them as well. The flavor works on hot and cold days, not too overpowering. I keep 4 on me on all of my longer rides. A must have for endurance training/riding.I run 65-100 miles per week. I use these for long runs (16-22 miles) and marathons. Gels are all pretty much the same price, unless you buy in to the Maurten hype and want to pay double for a gel. I know, flavor and effectiveness is going to be very subjective depending on the athlete, but I’ve tried the rest and these are the best (at least for me). Blueberry Pom doesn’t have life-changing flavor, but then no gel I’ve tried does. But it doesn’t have a funky lingering aftertaste either, as some gels/flavors can. It’s small enough to fit into the tiny pockets of runners shorts. It’s thick enough so I can safely open it and take my time ingesting it while running, avoiding messy leaks (no sticky hands and chin like other gels).I like to run long distances (20-31 miles) and these make such a huge difference in performance and mental clarity.Barely enough caffeine for me to notice but enough to give you that little boost.Easy to digest and great flavor.I never run without these.UPDATE: 23 SEP 2017I've been using the Blueberry Pomegranate for over a year now in many races. The taste is OK but my runner partners all hate it for some reason. The Cherry lime tastes better, but if you hated the Blueberry Pomegranate, you'll probably hate the Cherry Lime. Honestly, when I'm tearing down the road/trail in a race, I couldn't care less about taste. I'm sucking down that gel pack and looking for a bit of hydration, while trying to maintain a competitive pace, locate a garbage can / refuse drop zone, and try to finish a race. I only use the gels at the beginning of a race, or in the middle if it is longer than 45 minutes (like a 10K, 10 miler, half marathon, etc...)Original review:I purchased the Blueberry Pomegranate flavor and am glad I did so because it tastes great. It tastes just like their chews, except in semi-liquid form. It goes down very easily without the need for water. I find that it really does give me the energy I need to finish my race or activity. The instructions say to take it 5 minutes before, and every 45 minutes afterwards. My stomach doesn't digest stuff as quickly, so I have to experiment with how early to take it prior to a race.If you're going to run a race or participate in an event longer than 30 minutes, I highly recommend packing these gels. So far, the BCAAs have not upset my stomach. The caffeine really does work.I'd been using the normal Gu for quite some time -- Vanilla Bean flavor -- and found that it worked fairly well. The occasional minor stomach issue, but no big deal. I've never been a big fan of the very thick consistency, and since I was working my way through a large box the vanilla flavor started getting on my nerves.I decided to ""upgrade"" to Roctane and thought that switching over to something with a fruit flavor would help break me out of my vanilla rut...The good: Roctane has a considerably thinner consistency, which is awesome. Easier to eat, doesn't coat the mouth/throat as much, and feels much easier on the stomach. I also feel like the extra caffeine gives me a small bonus boost. And the BCAAs? I have no clue, but apparently they help with carb uptake. I can't measure that. Energy levels feel pretty much the same, but MAYBE a bit faster acting with Roctane. (Could be totally psychological since these things are damn expensive and I want them to work better.)The bad: The cherry lime flavor that I bought tastes like jellied, chemical-infused regret. Ugh. Almost laughably bad. I brought two Roctanes and a plain Gu Vanilla Bean on a recent long run, and ate the Roctanes first. The vanilla Gu was like a delicious special treat after the Roctanes.So, four stars, mainly due to taste.Next time I'll try the Vanilla Spice flavor.Esta marca la llevo utilizando años y es gama alta. Tiene cafeina con una dosis buena para una hora para mantenerte bien y aminoácidos para el desgaste muscular en pruebas largas de varias horas como por ejemplo maratón, media maratón o ciclismo en salidas de 100 kms en adelante. El sabor es muy bueno, los geles con cafeina suelen ser algo amargos pero este no, la densidad es viscosa, típico de estos geles pero se toma muy bien. Además el precio es muy bueno.Every Canadian retailer I've visited has big white stickers on the product to provide Canadian compliant nutrition information which ruins the gel packs. Your sweat makes the white sticker become disgusting chunks of paper that end up in your mouth during a race.I was hiking the lake superior coastal probably the most challenging trail i have hiked hiking for 4 days 10 hours a day my last day of the hike I felt dehydrated even though I was consuming plenty of water felt fain and lost my energy still with klm to go my friend offered me this gel energy pack I removed in about 15 and finished the hike I highly recommend it it works it truly does this product really pulled me through to the end will never go hiking without itRapporto qualità- prezzo insuperabile sul web, peccato che sia esaurito altrimenti l’avrei comprato di nuovo.Dimensione utile per attaccarli alla cintura e ottimo l’aiuto per le corse lunghe.

It's just that good.I was hesitant between getting this or the Elementum. I couldn't ever find the Elementum in stock, and the Dogma was 3$ cheaper, so I just got it. My main concern at first was that it looked too ""threatening"", and is a clip point instead of a drop point, and because of that massive finger choil.It all made sense the moment I held it in my hand. However, it did take some time for me to get used to the flipper and know how to open it properly. It came very sharp out of the box, and well lubricated.After disassembly for maintenance, I noticed hole marks where the bearing sits. Not sure if this was from the factory or if I accidentally tightened it too much. You don't feel it unless the pivot screw is too tight.When showing it off to other people, they all fall in love with it and seem less threatened by it than my SAK.The action is beautiful but does need a fair bit of maintenance. I'll try to explain what it feels like; It's a bit stiff on the first push, but you learn to slide your finger quickly from the top down which quickly deploys it without hurting your finger. After it deploys, you feel the blade gliding on ice for a very quick second, and then you hear the click, but don't feel any aggression. The amount of force it takes to break it off the detent forces your hand to grip it just enough that it doesn't move away from you, unlike some spring-assisted knives. This won't get loose over time, it's a ceramic ball pushing by the liner lock onto a hole in the D2 steel, so unless you forcefully bend the lock back, it'll be the same stiffness for the rest of its life.So where exactly are you compromising when you don't spent another 100$ on a fancier knife? Well this is a bit controversial. There are the G10 scales, but they do sell it in more premium materials for slightly mall.The D2 steel is IMO, great. I haven't had it rust, I just wipe it after every use. It keeps its edge for long, not as long as my LM Charge+ with it's 154CM blade, but it holds it for many weeks of daily carrying (assuming you strop it). I did accidentally open it against a metal table edge, which dinged up the tip a bit.However, it's on ball bearings and has a liner lock. The bearings need a lot of maintenance, and you do need to disassemble it for that. The liner lock on mine seems to be deforming slightly where it touches the tang, but there isn't any play. As far as I'm concerned this same bearing and liner lock is in every Civivi folder.Spend 3 times as much on something like a Spyderco PM2 (which I don't own), and you get S30V steel, normal phosphorus bronze washers, and a compression lock. This is a better setup, but not one worth 3x the price IMO.Overall, the Civivi Dogma is a fantastic knife that you can't beat for the price, and this is one purchase that I didn't have any regrets about. If you're looking for a utilitarian knife to cut food regularly, then maybe look elsewhere or at their cheaper 9cr18mov knives. But if that's you, then maybe a fixed blade would be better than a folder.","[""✅【Durable Blade】Durable D2 steel blade can handle hard use tasks as well as providing choil for better gripping control when you may need to cut small or tiny things."",""✅【Classic Textured Handle】G10 textured lightweight handle enhances the grip and blade control of this compact folder, fit in the hand comfortably."",""✅【Easy One-hand Opening】With ball bearings in the pivot,cool knife is easy to one hand open, solid liner lock secures the blade,work pocket knives for indoor and outdoor."",""✅【Knife as Perfect Gift】Well designed everyday carry folder is the kind of special gifts for husband from wife, nice as dad gifts,anniversary or Birthday,whether or not they're into knives."",""✅【Civivi Care】Civivi knives and tools provide a lifetime guarantee against defects in material and workmanship, see company site for details.""]"

Razer DeathAdder V2 Gaming Mouse: 20K DPI Optical Sensor - Fastest Gaming Mouse Switch - Chroma RGB Lighting - 8 Programmable Buttons - Ergonomic Shape - Halo Infinite Edition,Razer,"With over 10 million Razer DeathAdders sold, the most celebrated and awarded gaming mouse in the world has earned its popularity through its exceptional ergonomic design. Perfectly suited for a palm grip, it also works well with claw and fingertip styles. The Razer DeathAdder V2 continues this legacy, retaining its signature shape while shedding more weight for quicker handling to improve your gameplay. Going beyond conventional office ergonomics, the optimized design also provides greater comfort for gaming—important for those long raids or when you’re grinding your rank on ladder.","[""Video Games"",""PC"",""Accessories"",""Gaming Mice""]",‎Razer Inc.,,"Although I've never cared for the aesthetics or branding (it's very tryhard and aimed at teenagers) in of Razer the overall build quality, ergonomics, and responsiveness of the mouse overcome any reservations.This is a wired mouse but unlike traditional hard rubber coated mouse cables this one is wrapped in a soft but sturdy woven material. It makes it so it doesn't noticably resist as traditional mouse cables would which allows for smooth operation and makes for easy cable management. Not having to charge is great and makes the mouse light for it's size.The size is fairly large, a bit larger than I'm personally used to but not so much that it's uncomfortable. For most women or kids it might be too large though.It has lights with presets that can be turned off with Razer's software ( that you have to download unfortunately,) if you're into that. I turn mine off or on the lowest setting as I find them distracting.The buttons are nice and clicky and very fast. They are pretty sensitive with very little pressure needed to engage. Useful for gaming but not so sensitive that you'll misclick (at least for me). There are 7 main buttons, all programmable, more than most people need but they're good to have. The mouse wheel is nice and clicky and operates smoothly. The only thing I wish it had was a fast scroll option but this typically more useful when browsing than gaming. It's a compromise that I can understand. The extra buttons vs a 3 button mouse don't get in the way and are useful in a variety of games. I often use them as additional movement buttons.The tracking is very very sensitive if you're used to an office mouse but this is also fully adjustable for your own comfort and ability. The mouse also physically slides very smoothly across a mouse pad. I haven't tried it on other surfaces like glass or white tables which traditionally can sometimes give laser mice issues.My only gripe as others have pointed out is the main buttons can be a little bit wobbly if pushed from the side. This isn't something you would do while gaming but again as others as said if you were traveling with it you would want it in a hard case if it has the chance of getting knocked around at all.So overall I would recommend this mouse for pretty much any task or game. It does everything a mouse should do and it does it well.So my wireless Logitech G603 mouse is 2 years old and starting to show signs of aging. As such, I’ve decided to once again start trying out some new gaming mice.This time though, I’ve refocused my search on wired mice as wireless mice are said to have enough latency to affect gameplay. I’m not sure if that is relevant to a non-competitive casual player like myself, but I’m giving it a try.So I went with the Razer Deathadder V2 because the form factor is very close to my 603, and I love this button configuration. I have played a few games with it today and kind of felt like my wrist was raised a bit too high and it was causing some fatigue and discomfort. For those who don’t know, along with many other parts of my body, my wrists are also jacked up.The mouse also feels much lighter than my 603, so much so that it feels kind of weird. I think if I play with it for a while, I might adapt to it. But since there are so many other options available today, why settle on your first try?Overall, I actually like the mouse for what it is. Once I got the sensitivity right it was all good. But the front of it just feels like it’s raised just a bit too high which then causes the aforementioned fatigue.Someone suggested I try the Basilisk V3, and upon a quick glance it appears to meet the two-button requirement I have for the side, with an additional two others. I may have already tried this, but honestly after 20 mice trials, if I didn’t write the review then, I won’t remember. That’s why I’m doing this one right away for my initial thoughts. I’m going to use it a bit longer and I think I might give the basilisk a try. If I do you know it will end up here right away!Lo he probado ya mucho tiempo casi el año y me ha funcionado perfectamente, para juegos es brutal super bueno para cualquier tipo de actividad, el sofware lo instale y me parece perfecto pero para las cosas que yo hago no fue necesario la asignacion de nuevas teclas, no escogi otra version de renovados aunque estaban economicos pero en estos casos dd perifericos prefiero lo nuevo, no me arrepenti de mi compra y respeto al ultimate cableado no es de mi agrado por los botones que trea al lado derecho ya no son tan ergonomicos a mi gusto, por eso escogi este por mo tipo de agarre y tamaño de mi mano, la iluminacion super excelente, todo es un mause de buena calidsd si lo consigues por buen precio, te da mas de lo que pagas por elThis is a review of the 2020 deathadder v2, not the elite as some of the reviews on this page are for (not sure if that's a bug, but deathadder elite reviews should be on the elite page not the v2).To preface this, just wanted to say that I'm by no means bragging or boasting, just giving my 2 cents as someone who has played at one of the highest levels of CS. I played ESEA-Premier/MDL as well as CEVO P. My first ever gaming mouse was the deathadder, loved the original shape and it's been my main mouse ever since.I have tried just about as many other alternatives as I can including the Zowie EC2 A, Zowie EC1, Finalmouse, Steelseries Rival, Logitech G403, xtrfy m4, etc. I always somehow going back to the Deathadder because of it's shape, I guess I've just gotten so acclimated to it. Since 2009 I've gone through about 4 of them, some have been due to wear from the left trigger button, and one because the side buttons stopped working. Though one of the biggest issues for ME has ALWAYS been the cheap and horrendous side grips which always fall off after 6-8 months. Hot glue, gorilla glue, nothing would make it stay. So after countless iterations of the deathadder, finally the v2 has addressed this issue and more.Major changes that are small but absolutely game changing:-Side grips are now integrated into the left and right side of the mouse, they are a physical part of the shell and therefore cannot fall off, this makes cleaning easier-20k dpi is absurd but the sensor is improved and has a higher IPS than the elite-mouse skates are similar to the elite and are now two much larger pads that cover the top and bottom of the mouse, much better than the previous tiny skates they had prior-the shape on the right mouse button has been ever so slightly adjusted, it doesn't flare out as much and feels more comfortable to grip-weight has been reduced to 82g-the DPI buttons, which I don't use, are more spaced out and therefore avoids accidental hitting-Mouse switches are optical, they're not as loud and feel just as responsive as beforeAll in all, this is definitely the best iteration of the deathadder they've put out. It improves on things that have been a hinderance on every model since 2009.I am not a pro gamer or anything but I can definitely say this mouse is incredible. I came from a cheap Logitech M310 productivity mouse of 1000DPI but the Deathadder V2 with 20000DPI is a gamechanger for me. I use it at around 2000DPI and everything feels so much more responsive and accurate. I have medium-sized hands and this feels a bit big for me but I got used to it.All the extra buttons work on macOS. The top two small buttons work for changing DPI & thumb buttons work on Chrome for navigating webpages forward or backward (didn't work on firefox). I think the buttons worked after I installed synapse 3 on Windows 10 through Bootcamp and configured it.CONS:There is no Synapse 3 on macOS, which is a big downer for me. I can still store profiles using Synapse on Windows though.PROS:ErgonomicSuper responsiveVery lightweightAll the extra buttons work on macOSRazer software caused my computer to act up. Computer was running fine until I plugged in the razer, started having boot issues and wasnt able to use the mouse in bios. I think this mouse is over priced too. I dont think I trust razer at this point. Had to reformat my computer because of this.Edit: 6 months later: So the 5th Mouse still has loose clicks, feels spongy and cheap, and now the scroll wheel is creaking very loudly and grinding when scrolling upwards. Absolutely pathetic QC for these units In my opinion. And Razer support is notoriously horrible at customer service. I'm going to RMA it but use it as a backup once I buy a mouse that's not trash.Edit: Got a 5th, it still has issues. Scroll wheel feels and sounds really cheap, left click is rather loose, razer support is absolutely horrible. After 1 month of back and forth emails all they offered me was a 15% off coupon from their website, which would only barely cover the 10$ shipping, and give me 3$ off the product.EDIT: Got a 4th one just to be sure, it also has left click issues and a creaky right side / bottom. Buyer beware. Think i’ll look at Logitech and Corsair instead.The mouse itself is great, performance is exactly what you'd expect. It's like my Chroma was, but better, lighter, faster.That being said, the first Deathadder V2 I purchased had a very loud scroll wheel that would vibrate the mouse when using, the 2nd one had inconsistent click on the right / left side. The right mouse button protruded a little to the right, and required more force to click down. The third one I just received, had no mouse click issues, but the same loud scroll wheel that was actually WORSE than the first one.Might be worth mentioning they're all from Taiwan, not china.Really lost faith in Razer QC as these mice are all brand new, and frankly not cheap at $90 CAD.Ok after the first og deathadder i had every single version of this legendary mouse but since the v2 version with optical switch which is really the only way i tough it would get rid of thoses old all kinds of contacts Switchs omron, and all variants so back to the wired version v2 didn't like the right click being really moushy and feel like cheaply made so i did return it. Then the v2 pro wireless came and was on a really good deal at 99.99$cad 80$ off is a freaking nice deal and there's the culprit even razer said 2nd gen optical switch tought it would be better right? Honestly same rediculious problem right click is so moushy and feel so cheap that disappointing the only good is its wireless but for me sadly the deathadder is dead bad product quality. Never again stilk miss the old og rubberized texture instead of cheap platic sand paper feel. If i could give 0 ⭐ i would im sorry but save your money find an alternative but for me I'll keep my Mamba wireless even if a lot of people didn't like it mine still hold after a year without double click on any right or left side i will expect to happen soon or late and will beed a switch swap job I'm not afraid of.","[""Custom-designed with Halo Infinite theme​ based on Master Chief John-117’s motif"",""Focus+ 20K DPI Optical Sensor: Auto-calibrates across mouse mat and reduces cursor drift from lift-off and landing for industry-leading precision"",""3x Faster Than Traditional Mechanical Switches: New Razer optical mouse switches uses light beam-based actuation, registering button presses at the speed of light"",""Immersive, Customizable Chroma RGB Lighting: Supports 16.8 million colors w/ included preset profiles; syncs with gameplay and Razer Chroma-enabled peripherals and Philips Hue products"",""8 Programmable Buttons: Allows for button remapping and assignment of complex macro functions through Razer Synapse 3"",""Drag-Free Cord for Wireless-Like Performance: Razer Speedflex cables eliminate the need for mouse bungees, drastically reducing weight and drag for absolute control""]"

After doing some research I decided to go with these even though they were a little bit more expensive. Worth it. I tried one of the cheaper ones years ago, and I hated those little capsule things you would use to adhere then. The stuff Scarecrow uses is great. It lasted over a 3 day weekend and they are still holding up. Not sure about other complaints, but trust me these are better than the cheap ones.They match my teeth and stay put, and look like real teeth!What more could you ask for??PS. Wash them after use.I have always loved the Scarecrows brand Vampire teeth, they are very sturdy and easy to place.I bought these because I loved the design of the fangs, however they seemed to be too big for my teeth. Following along with the instructions I made one of the capsules, put it into the fang and onto my tooth. At first it seemed to work and then I realized that I needed a bit more of the adhesive, and then it worked. I tried repeating the process on my other tooth and had no success of the tooth taking. Part of me believes that this experience is due to the size of my teeth. I believe wholeheartedly that this product would have work if my teeth were larger.Due to the partial success I had I decided to purchase the smaller set of fangs and try again.These were not difficult to set and are the standard for a reason. I tried the smaller fangs in the past, but they fit my teeth awkwardly, and these were far better.LOVE these! i bought the small and classic sizes for comparison... because that what i do sometimes... :-PSMALLPRO: the smaller size is more subtle. they are great for everyday use & are supper cute. they are not as white as others. easy to follow the instructions, but you need to follow the instructionsCON: the part of the teeth that covers the real teeth (height) doesn't cover the whole tooth, but when I smile/talk you can't see that part. the self-adhesive material only works the 1st time but its what makes the teeth fit/mold to your teethOTHER: i wanted the teeth to look more ""natural"", so, i i took my handy-dandy nail file and got to work... ​i filed the top of the teeth to match the shape of my natural gum-line. i also filed down part of the thickness of the front of the teeth to blend a little better across the front of the teeth. this did take off the coating of the teeth, but that helped with the next part. i put the teeth in coffee for about 5-6 minuets to tint them closer to my teeth and rinsed (it looked like they were going to be too dark until i rinsed them, then they were great!) i use Fixodent Ultra and these stay in a good 8-10 hours. i can even eat finger-food with them in, too (after some practice). if you use denture adhesive, wipe away the extra after following the instructions. i use a wet toothbrush to go over the area to get any i can't see... otherwise you WILL get dry mouth from the adhesiveCLASSICPROS: the part that covers the teeth actually covers the real tooth up to the gum-line. noticeable length. can't miss it when i put these in. not as white as other brands. the ""custom"" material is easy to use IF you read & follow the instructionsCONS: the length makes everyday wear difficult. great for a costume or short-term wear. only self-adhesive the first time, but it material helps make them fit your teeth (custom).OTHER: i wanted the teeth to look more ""natural""... so, i did the same thing to these as i did with the size smalls... took a nail file and got to work then followed up with the coffee i wanted to drinkGripes: 1. Wouldn't fit over my canines & 2. Left fang stabbing into my gums when fitting the right incisor.Full Experience:These look AMAZING!!! So natural.I did have to go to their YouTube to watch the video they link (from 14yrs ago!) on how to prep & apply, but it was simple to follow.I'll admit I looked like a doofus wearing these on my incisors for BIPOC Vamp Day. The shorter style wasn't available when I purchased & the classics wouldn't work for my canines. My canines aren't very pointy, but I guess they aren't flat enough in the back like my incisors? *[I'll try again & will only update if it works out. So, if I don't update then it still didn't work for me].The fang for my right incisor was stabbing into my gums when fitting no matter how I shifted. It didn't take as well due to me shifting to find a comfortable position as the glue was setting. The hold isn't as firm (slips a bit easily), but I can still reuse it. The left set perfectly.They do look really good & pretty natural. I just wish I could've worn them on my canines. The incisors just didn't work well for my look unless I hit the right angles.They're pricey, but the quality & fact that they're reusable makes up for it. I'd still feel comfortable recommending.love these teeth!! they're pretty simple to apply, only thing is that I, ironically, have very sharp pointy canines but these aren't really designed for teeth shaped like that, you CAN make them work but I personally thought it'd be easier to fit them to the teeth either side of my front ones (as seen in photos.) they still look pretty cool and they're really easy to put on and take off once the gel hardens. They really are just the perfect finishing touch to my costume, and ill have them for all other cosplay related ventures in the future too, which is awesome. :)Before I attempted to use these I watched the YouTube presentation as recommended. All worked exactly as described. Waited 15 minutes after setting the second fang then removed them. Tried them on again and there is no mechanism to keep them on! Push them onto your teeth and they just fall off. Useful if you need to take a mould of your canine tooth otherwise absolutely uselessFirstly... Check them out on me... [ h t t p : / / b i t . l y / U 7 M z J X ] - Obviously remove the spaces :pThey are outstanding. Great product, Look natural, feel comfortable, easy to apply and fit, stayed in all night, easy to talk and drink (although advised not to drink just incase but it didn't stop me getting smashed :p) and easy to remove.They look even better with blood dripping from them :pSuper product, super fast delivery. THANKS :D xThese are awesome, a bit wired putting them in the the cement and all but once they are in and stuck (which is a task) they really finished if the look, panicked a bit trying to get them off (especially when intoxicated) just nite down on them and the cement comes loose DO NOT try to break them off nor bend themHad no problem with sizing. My only issue was I was rushed in making up the glue and applying the fangs. I did not leave long enough so needed to reapply. My only advice is read the instructions carefully and thoroughly. The look of the fangs is awesome. So much better that the cheapy kids hinged ones. The colour match was perfect too.",[]

Read more","[""Home & Kitchen"",""Kitchen & Dining"",""Kitchen Utensils & Gadgets"",""Bar & Wine Tools"",""Cocktail Shakers""]",Stock Harbor LLC,,"The box was came with broken but inside item was ok.Very nice product.I will be returning mine, if you're into the size of it, then good on ya. I got it with the intention of using it with a pint glass and a strainer (those straining lids aren't my cup of tea) and the thing practically envelopes the entire pint glass I'm a 6' tall male with average sized hands, and holding this thing for a shake is just not going to happen.My daughter was looking for a mixing shaker to make Bubble Tea.When we searched online most of the shakers that we saw were made of cheap plastic; not great for mixing hot tea and cold ice. Many of the other mixers were primarily metal cups; again, not great for hot drinks. We also found that many of the reviews on these mixers commented on the fact that they either leaked profusely or created a vacuum seal that made the lids hard to open when mixing hot liquids with ice.The Stock Harbor Stainless Steel Double Wall Cocktail Shaker solves all of these problems. The shaker looks great and is very well made. The double wall cup allows you to mix both hot and cold liquids without burning or freezing your hands. The shaker cap allows you to put enough pressure on the top so that there are no leaks (make sure that you press it hard while shaking to prevent small leaks), while still easily coming off with no vapor lock issues once you are done mixing. The cap’s built in strainer holds any ice back as you pour the liquid out of the mixing shaker. The cup also comes with a leak proof drinking lid that makes it easy to take with you if you want to do that too.We spent a lot of time looking at the mixing shakers that were available on the market (probably too much time to be honest). The Stock Harbor shaker was by far the best design that we found – and it’s worked great for every drink concoction that we’ve made. My daughter and I highly recommend it!First question is leakproof.... that's a 2 part answer. When shaking... yes, it works well... but then it gets dicey. The ""jigger"" is the cap to the shaker. There is no seal... it is metal on metal which means you must physically hold the cap against the shaker while shaking. No, not hard to do but a bit inconvenient. Then, when you take the cap off to pour there is some gin (or?) trapped between the strainer built into the removable top of the shaker and the cap. If you let it sit for 5 seconds it will drain out. It would be better to have the strainer as an option because they simply don't work as well as a strainer from your bar. They hold the crushed ice and clog up and you end up making a mess trying to get the holes cleared (shaking) and pouring. Therefore I remove the top and cap together as a unit (have to hold them together) and pour out the shaker through my own strainer which is faster and easier. Shaker is EXTREMELY well insulated and a perfect surface that is easy to grip and comfortable to the touch. Jigger cap frosts over nicely to give an indication of how cold your mix has become.The cup part itself is 'thermos' type material, to keep the liquid cold. The exterior finish has a nice feel to it.And after initially being disappointed that the measurements were in/on the shaker itself, I was very pleased to see that it looks like a travel coffee cup!!! And the travel top is quite spill proof. (I have hidden the travel top so no one STEALS it and I lose my shaker set). So don't ask me what I'm drinking (keep walking, don't judge me...).The shaker top fits snugly and there is a very small metal cup that seals the top (it doubles as a shot measurement) and the only 'CON' is that the metal top cup isn't as snug as I'd like, when you take that small top cup off, there is a tiny bit of spillage. But overall, totally worth it.We made cocktails late the first evening we had the Stock Harbor shaker. The ice inside was still unmelted the next morning! No more cold hands while making a cocktail, plus the to-go cover makes this a 5-star purchase. Love that the logo placements are subtle and the whole device is a very classy brushed metal. It's also bigger than most shakers I've seen.The main lid with the strainer has a great vacuum seal, but the top jigger/lid fits very loosely. Luckily we figured this out while cleaning it first instead of while trying to mix a drink.Wish it was dishwasher safe, but I undrestand it not being so.See photo of the box side - “listening closely to our customers” - There are a lot of reviews that mention leaks!! We will be looking for improvements. Temporary fix: wide rubber band around the top sealed it.Plus: insulated, sipping cap. Made in the US of A.Minus: Leaks, as others have mentioned. Must be losing sales from that! Fix it and it will be 5 stars.Love everything about this mixer except the top cap. It fits loosely over the strainer cap and must hold well when shaking. After shaking some of the mix (3 or 4 large drops) will always run down the container side when you remove the top cap. So I always keep a towel handy. Not sure if this was a flaw in mine or if all have this problem. Have not heard anyone else complain about this. Other than the cap issue I have, this is the perfect Mixer.","[""Revolutionary patent pending double wall vacuum insulated shaker top and large 30 ounce shaker cup keeps your cocktail cold, not your hands, for hours and hours."",""Features include an improved vacuum insulated shaker top (upper part) that dramatically improves the overall insulating capabilities, a heavy duty and secure sealing ring to keep your drinks inside the shaker where they belong, a sweat-proof vacuum insulated cup, and a convenient & completely spill-proof drinking lid for enjoying hot or cold beverages on the go.

In fact, 80% of dogs and 70% of cats begin to show signs of oral disease by age 3. With TropiClean Fresh Breath Dental Health Solution Plus Hip & Joint, dogs can benefit from daily plaque and tartar defense, simply by drinking from their water bowl. Plus, glucosamine helps promote healthy hips and joints. Easy to use for both you and your dog—no brushing required.","[""Pet Supplies"",""Cats"",""Health Supplies"",""Dental Care""]",‏  ‎ Cosmos Corporation,,"No scent, can’t tel you what it tastes like bc I didn’t try it. But morning and night when we refill the dogs bowls we add a splash to it the waters it foams up for a minute and then disappears. We have two English bulldogs and both have horrendous breath. One of our dogs especially, you gag when she is in your face. Probably from the chicken poop she scavenges around the farm. About two weeks have gone by and she is laying in my lap and panting with NO SMELL!!!! Miracle!!My dog seems to like this. We put a bunch in his water. He has pretty bad acidic breath, and he periodically vomits. His breath has this sort of acid reflux smell to it. And, we brush his teeth every day with an enzymatic tooth paste. Nothing helped. However, ever since using this stuff, his breath seems to have gotten much better. Too soon to say, but it's been a month now, and it seems to be helping.My pups do not even notice that I add this product to their water bowls. But, I have noticed their breath is much improved. Pleased.I’ve used this in my dog’s water since he was a puppy. He NEVER has dog breath. It’s always fresh. I love this product.Been using this product for years and the results are fantastic, Highly recommendedMy dog's are hunters that kill and eat everything from moles to groundhogs. Their breath is absolutely HORRID, even with regular teeth cleaning.We've been using this dental water for over two years now and it definitely works wonders on combating their death breath. It doesn't get rid of it entirely but you will, beyond a doubt, notice a huge difference with regular use of this product.If we go a couple days without adding it there's a noticeable difference in the potency of their breath.Needless to say, we use this product religiously!Will admit that I was skeptical that somethings so easy would have results. I have four sharpies and they have very wet males which lead to bacteria and that means smell. This is easy to use and works beautifully. Now when I get kisses every morning, they are completely fresh and they’re nice to getInstead of trying to brush your pet's teeth, make it easy each time they drink water. It has no taste & keeps their oral health in check every time!Doesn’t smell but you can see it sink when you add it to the water. No ingredients on the bottle and made in the USA so I ended up pouring it away. I don’t feel comfortable with US made chemical products without listed ingredients after watching stink on Nflicks.Feeding my animal chemicals just for my benefit seems cruel. I mean he still licks himself clean after doing his 1’s and 2’s so a smelly breath serves as a reminder when he comes up for a kiss!Please please do not use this product. At first we thought it was good, however our dog started to vomit. At first it was infrequent but then progressively got worse. After blood tests at the vets it was confirmed that she had raised liver levels. We showed the vet this product and she said with certainty that it was the culprit. We stopped using it and the vomiting stopped. More blood tests in a month to check if it has had lasting damage.DO NOT BUY!!! I’m giving a 5-star in hopes of my review being SEEN! Should have read other customer reviews, however, they are filtered for best reviews at the top, hiding all the BAD reviews. My dogs would not drink water for days after adding and after a couple of days we discovered MOLD allllll over the water dish. Tried on 2 occasions with different concentrations to be sure. DISGUSTING AND DISTURBING! I read some of the other reviews and this stuff makes other people’s dogs SICK and VOMIT. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! Also you will not be able to return or get a refund from the seller. Flavour bad, thickness bad, scent bad (mentioned only for the algorithm). BEWARE!Massively improved Nellie's breath which could melt a Welly Boot from 6feet!She's a 9yo Jack Russell and is prone to smelly breath.This improved her breath in a couple of days.This product does work and i did like but after a few months i noticed my dogs faces were going an orange color,of course when you have a cream dog it looks like they have rust all around their mouth and beard with being lvery long coated, my black and white dog got a brown face so sadly i had to stop using this all together, now theirfaces are clean and bright again but it did take a while for me to get rid of it, so if you have a light color dog please be aware!","[""Fresh Dog Breath - Say goodbye to bad dog breath!

"Adagio Teas ingenuiTEA Bottom-Dispensing Teapot,clear,16 oz",Adagio Teas,"IngenuiTEA is a brilliant - arguably the simplest - device for preparing loose tea. Unlike the 'French Press' teapots which crush and bruise the leaves, our teapot's ingenious design uses gravity, not force, to strain the leaves. The result is great taste with less effort. To filter, simply place the ingenuiTEA atop your cup. A valve at the bottom will open, allowing crystal-clear tea to flow, while a mesh filter retains the leaves and sediment. The clean-up is equally as easy as the teapot is dishwasher safe. Made in Taiwan using food-grade plastic. Available in 16 oz. as well as 32 oz. size that's ideal for brewing a pitcher of iced tea. Perfect for foodservice, restaurant and other professional industrial uses. Bulk pricing available through Adagio Wholesale.","[""Home & Kitchen"",""Kitchen & Dining"",""Dining & Entertaining"",""Dinnerware & Serveware"",""Teapots & Coffee Servers"",""Teapots""]",Adagio Teas,Kitchen,"I’ve owned a few infusers of this overall style, and this is easily the best. The removable filter is nice for cleaning.The measurement lines are a great feature, so you know exactly how much hot water to add for a given size cup. It should be standard on every one of these things.The handle is worth special attention. A lot of infusers have handles that aren’t particularly comfortable to hold, and the ergonomic grip on this is a definite improvement. It’s a small thing, but I could definitely see it being helpful for someone with mobility issues.My sole quibble is that, like many such infusers, it’s prone to having a small amount of liquid get stuck in the bottom. Tilting it can help it along. It’s a very minor complaint, however, and it’s not unique to this model either.It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. Our story begins in Summer 2013, which is when our main character, henceforth known as Downstairs Neighbor (DN) makes his existence known to us. After I come back from a long-ish summer vacation, DN feels compelled to inform the building manager of my existence, including hearing my footsteps. Listen, I walk with purpose, but I am no Stampy and you would think that someone that chooses to live below someone would anticipate hearing them, I don't know, breathe occasionally. After building manager relays this message, I feel bad for being a nuisance and try to be more quiet. Soon I realize that I'm not the problem: it's the DN. His actions include calling the police on a crew that the building hired to replace the building roof, which was as noisy as you'd expect it to be but calling the police on the crew is not the solution (the foreman dropped by to ask me if I was okay with the noise and told me about him calling the police). DN also has not one but TWO disabled parking spots (he lives alone) but regularly parks in one of the regular spots when his disabled parking spots are sitting open. My building doesn't have assigned parking but it's also not like AMPLE. A couple of summers ago, I decide to have a summer garden and at some point while watering my one and a half springs of parsley and half cucumber plants, I do so while he's outside and water drops land in his vicinity. Heavens! Naturally, management gets a phone call about this. They ask me to go down and apologize to him and I refuse because this is how 68% of horror movies start. Instead, I write DN a note and ask management to pass along. So at this point we are all on the same page that he hates me and I hate him, right? Okay. Fast forward to New Years' Day On 2017. I wake up at 7 AM from a really loud banging noise. I assume the next door neighbors who like to get it on at 4AM and have woken me up so many times that I have started wearing foam earplugs to bed are at it again. I ignore it and try to go back to sleep. The banging happens on and off (one example was at 6AM after I went to sleep at 2AM after traveling literally all day). At some point, I can't take it any more and ask the management to talk to the next door neighbors to cool it. Except.. PLOT TWIST! It's not next door neighbors. It's DN! Who apparently told management that since they are not doing anything to fix the ""problem"" he was going to take things into his own hands. The problem? Me showering ""late""; as in, showering around midnight after traveling all day long (because come on! you have to shower if you've been traveling for 9+ hours). So we learn that DN literally throws his shoes (or other objects) at his own ceiling whenever I dare to deviate from his rulebook of my behavior (at this point I'm willing to put up with it, just give me a copy of the rulebook)!!! Currently we are at an impasse where I don't shower after 9PM and don't report it to the management when he is blocking in 8-9 cars by parking 2 cars on the driveway and he doesn't toss his belongings at the ceiling.Fast forward to today: I'm expecting the delivery of this wonderful item which i expect the post office will leave in front of my doorstep. Except no! Amazon is delivering it. Naturally, they email me approximately 5 times and even call me once telling me that they cannot find a ""secure"" location to leave the package. I provide instructions to leave on the porch (hoping they'll just leave it in front of my door) but they refuse. I ask them to take it to management office; they refuse. After approximately 5 attempted deliveries between 12 and 4, I finally get a notice that it's been delivered! Hallelujah!! There is even a picture to prove that the package was left in front of my door!! Except that's not my door and I don't know whose door it is!! Before running around all around the building looking for my package and have to field questions from neighbors about what exactly I am up to, I go to the management office and ask them if they can ID the door.Reader, it's the DN's door. Which of course you probably guessed at this point. Management calls DN and asks if they've seen a package. Not only have they seen and brought in the package, they have also opened it and decided that they're not into tea as much as I am. The package, now opened, eventually makes its way to my door and me and my newfound tea obsession live happily ever after.The teapot itself is great.I’m a big tea drinker and this was a less expensive way to make my loose leaf teas. I absolutely love it, it is a bit hard to clean the screen out but if you rinse it enough it will come clean just fine. Super cool fits on all my mugs!Love loose leaf tea and can’t live without this brew mug. It makes the perfect cup every time. Easily to use and clean. Last a long time. Kid and mesh filter are removable.I like this because it brews a good amount of tea, is easy to use, and easy to keep clean. I ordered tea at a coffee shop and they prepared the tea with the IngenuiTea maker and I immediately ordered my own. Love it!I use this to microwave water, then add any desired tea..works with tea bags as well as loose tea. Great gift idea for me.It works as described. Hasn't leaked. Plunger at bottom dependable so far.This is a great invention. However after using a couple times, the main part slightly changed shape so that the lid no longer forms a tight seal. Still love it. Easy to clean and use. Wish it hadn't warped.Saw this and, always a sucker for a gadget, thought I'd give it a go. It makes a good brew and the transparent body really lets you see how the strength is coming along. The filter does catch all but the smallest of the leaves. My only gripe and the reason for my less than stellar star rating is IT LEAKS! Sometimes a droplet, sometimes a dribble, and sometimes a full on puddle. I've taken to always using with a saucer as I was getting bored of wiping up the spills.**REVIEW UPDATE**I'm updating this review having now used it for a number of months. It's certainly not living up to its early promise and it rather disappointing.We drink various teas with it but more recently the taste of mint tea seems to have 'stuck' to it regardless of cleaning. Furthermore, the base now leaks even when not in use. If we don't drain all of the fluid from it whrn using, and then leave it on the side, when we return to it later there is always a puddle on the worktop underneath it.We've since bought a more traditional brewing pot and we are having better results.I'd only recommend this for occasional use.Makes a nice cup of tea, simply put in the tea leaves, add water and let it brew then put it on your cup and the water flows in. Or hold over the cup and push the base up to let the water drain out. Just be careful that the cup is big enough for the water in the infuser if you put the infuser on the top as it'll drain all the water out. The filter can be pulled out, first time may feel like needs some effort, to make cleaning easier. I've rated flavour in the review but to be honest that's down to the tea used, but didn't want to bring down the overall rating. Doesn't need to keep the tea warm for long, as only used for long enough to brew it then transfer to your cup.Saw this being used at a tea shop I visited in London and knew I needed one in my life. I was deciding between the IngenuiTea and the T2 Tea Maker. I decided to purchase this product instead. It makes my life easier brewing loose teas, usually I struggle with tea infusers sitting in my mug and finding a plate to put the infuser once it's done and of course some loose leafs falling into the bottom of the mug. With the IngenuiTea you add the tea leaves and hot water let it brew for the desired time. Then the magic happens just sit the tea infuser on any mug and the tea seeps through. Leaving crystal clear tea without any loose leaves sitting in your mug. Clean up is easy, just give it a rinse and use some liquid soap and let it air dry. Will be purchasing the bigger one to use at home.The photographs do not do this product justice; the plastic is much like a crystal clear acrylic and looks more expensive.The functionality of the teapot is almost futuristic and is lot of fun to use. It can be used with loose tea or tea bags; I have also used it with ground coffee the filter is very fine.The only minor problem is that there is always a single drip after pouring, which typically happens if you have sat it on a table/cloth without a small saucer under it. Apart from this i have had no other issues with it and use it most days - guests and, in particular children, are usually intrigued by its operation.To go with the ingenuitea i would recommend a clear cup or mug so that you can see when it is full without the risk of it over flowing.","[""Great for the office or when traveling, this innovative teapot releases infused tea directly into a drinking cup"",""When tea is ready, simply place over cup and tea will drain from bottom"",""A mesh filter retains all the leaves with one of the best infusers on the market"",""Dishwasher safe, the teapot is made in Taiwan of food-grade plastic"",""It holds up to 16 ounces and has an easy-grip handle""]"

We are both happy. Credit needs to be given when it is deserved. GOOD job Guys 😇👍This is my daily travel bag and I love everything about it! I was looking for something that was both stylish, durable, and just the right size for the daily commute. Oh! And had enough space for an umbrella and water bottle too. The magnetic strap is a definite plus too. My only grip is with the outside zipper, which I wish was a bit easier to pull open as I would prefer to keep quick grab-n-go stuff like napkins and sanitizer in it but the amount of strength needed to pull it is not worth the trouble, so I just use the hidden compartment instead. Otherwise, it gets an A+ from me.Actually I wasn't expecting much, I buy a lot of bags in many sizes and types. However, I end up changing them within a week or less for a better one, because they don't comply with my on the move life, I travel a lot.The material is GREAT, I've dropped it, spilled it, and even scratch it randomly when using the metro. Keeps looking like brand new!!!!The box is very fancy and presentation gives you a nice feeling about your new item.Dislikes:I have a 13inch laptop (Samsung Galaxy Book Pro) which actually fits, but it takes a bit of an effort to put it in (iPads have no issue). Maybe because it's still not stretched enough, I'll see later on.Definitely keeping this one for a longer period of time, and preferred for travel.I’m impressed with this handsome travel bag and it’s design details, super functional features, and obvious built-in quality.From the moment I opened the Amazon box and saw a classy black manufacturer’s box, I knew I was meeting a company that holds quality and design a top priority. I expected a simple plain box or even just a plastic bag to hold this item, but NIID™ took it a step up.I already expected to purchase a well designed and unique bag as shown by the product photos and product video, and I was pleased to find the product was as handsome and durable as I expected. I did have trouble figuring out how to fit my first generation iPad Pro 12.9” in the bag, but I’m sure I’ll figure it out.Having this travel bag in hand and exploring the endless possibilities of storage for my belonging is a fun task. I’m blown away by how versatile this bag is. Most of all I’m really pleased with how attractive this item is. It’s clean lines and smooth hardware is that of a high end designer bag.Without a doubt I would recommend this bag and the company NIID™ to my friends and family. CHECK IT OUT..Great product.It is a wonderful bag! It holds everything in place!I am pretty disappointed... it is basically my grandmother's bag on a sling. Bulky, holds less than my prvious sling bag but feels bigger. NOt very practical to use. I like that I can stick my glasses in the pouches without having to deal with zippers etc. When I can get it on right it fits well in the curve of my back and doesn't slide around. Waay to expensive for what I got thoughGreat bag with many useful pockets and functions.I really like the size and design.Only reason I purchase this bag is to carry my iPad Pro 12.9 and I should've read the reviews first before I purchase this. It does not fit with any kind of case on it. If you don't have any case, it does fit but inside compartment only covers 2/3 of the device and rest is open and I'm afraid it may be scratched by other items I put in this bag.I really want to keep this bag but I'm going to return this since it does not serve my purpose. I hope NIID makes the second version little bit bigger so that it will fit iPad pro with keyboard case securely.I bought this bag for the futuristic ergonomic design and was expecting quite a lot from the priceIT OVER DELIVERSthe quick release buckle had come in so handy, especially when on the go.

Simplicity is critical to Dr. Bach’s system, he wanted everyone to be able to understand which remedy relates to their situation and why. He categorized the remedies into seven emotional groupings to further help you find the right personal remedy or mix.

He is 16 yrs old in 11th grade.I would toss and turn for a closer 2 hours before actually falling asleep. Tracking my sleep cycle was devastating. That's when somebody suggested. Bach White Chestnut. I was a nightly user of unisom and needed something else. What did I have to lose? The answer is nothing. So I got it, tried it out and immediately noticed a difference. I fell asleep the first night probably within half hour and it only got better from there down to 20 minutes down to 15 minutes. Now I lay in bed for maybe 10 and I'm out like a light. This stuff is a game changer and I stay asleep longer and have better quality sleep! I put two drops in my water at the end of the night and I sip it until I'm ready for bed and voila. That's all there is to it. Very excited to try the other products this brand has.This flower remedy seems to do exactly what I need it to do. I chose this one by consulting Bach's list of remedies and really thinking about what what I needed it to help me with. I have used it about 5 times, just before going into a situation that I know will bother me. Lo and behold - the situation mellowed out! I was able to get through it without being as stressed by it as usual.These tinctures are amazing! I have used them for well over thirty years. They are safe enough to use on my grandchildren. They help with emotional issues or any character trait that hinders happiness. I even have a mixture for Jetlag. In a separate bottle I use 2 to 4 drops of 4: walnut for transition, white chestnut for clarity and olive for fatigue. Put in distilled water with a bit of brandy and it will take you to two weeks of travel. 4 drops under the tongue 4 times per day before trip and until adjusted.

"Superfeet Unisex's Memory Foam Comfort Plus Support Shoe Inserts for Anti-Fatigue Replacement Insole, Copper, 5.5-7 Men / 6.5-8 Women",Superfeet,"Simply wear SUPERFEET COPPER insoles to create perfect impressions of your feet — No casting or baking required. The memory foam of the comfort insoles capture the shape from the pressure of your foot while you walk, stand or run through the day. Superfeet COPPER Inserts offers a flexible accommodating shape for personalized support.","[""Health & Household"",""Health Care"",""Foot Health"",""Inserts & Insoles"",""Insoles""]",‏  ‎ Superfeet,‏  ‎ Unisex-adult,"The copper inserts are super comfortable and provided some of the best support I've ever experienced in an insole. Unfortunately, the rigid support of the heel to arch adds ""height"" under the foot and reduces the vertical space inside the shoe. When I put these in my sneakers, my heels were lifted to a point that it rubbed uncomfortably against the back of the shoe, and when I took them out and replaced them with a different insole I did not have this problem.This maybe wouldn't be an issue if you had a shoe with a lot of internal ""height"" or if you put these in a shoe that came up above your ankle, but for casual everyday shoes, these might not be for you.I love SuperFeet and the copper was what I needed. I ordered Saucony Peregrine Wide which was fine width-wise, but like so very many wide shoes, they were extra high as well and therefore floppy. When I weighed 70# more ""wide"" shoes fit fine. Now that all I want is something to accommodate bony wideness and no vertical fat. So thanks Superfeet Copper!!!NoFit in boots perfect. No more foot pain with these insoles. Will buy again.Affordable, durable, and stable my son's feet. He used this support with all his shoes(tennis, causal, and walking)I'll be honest and say that i haven't tried a lot of different insoles outside of a few Dr. Scholl's, timberland pros, and keen utility insoles. With that being said i would put these superfiot copper insoles at the top of my list and Keen utility as a solid second. I spend anywhere from 11 to 14 hours on my feet from the moment I wake up until the moment I walk back into my house. I work in a Shipyard doing repairs and new construction of various vessels so i am ALWAYS on the move through all sorts of terrain, walking across pipes, climbing and jumping off of unite/blocks, ladders, scaffolding, you name it. My feet definitely take a pounding on the day to day. I haven't found a reason to not continue to buy these as they wear down from taking a beating. I'd say they last around 5-6 months before i have to replace them. That's pretty normal for my work life. Hope this helps!My foot doctor recommended Superfeet inserts while I was waiting to have my foot surgery. I have bought this kind and the Black ones because they were labeled ""low"" for people with low arches. They fit into my hiking boots and a few of my sneakers without having to trim them, and they are very reasonable in price. I am a 7.5/8 in a shoe and this is the size I purchased. I haven't had to to trim these at all. I put them in my hiking boots today and walked 2 1/2 hours, up and down the paths of the NC Arboretum and my legs and feet felt fine, no tiredness or pain at all. I recommend this product for a short term solution to foot problems.This product offers great heel support! I felt the difference the first try I put them on, they feel great. I just wished the glue holding the insole and the plastic heel support was of better quality. After transferring them from one pair of shoes to another a couple of times they became unglued. They still work well, but it is a bummer having to line them up everything I use a different pair of shoes.The arch in these have way too much give compared to the black Superfeet (though the arch is higher, they give much more under pressure). They're supposed to be for people who have fallen arches; I didn't expect that much give.Also, the heel cup is very tall. These would not fit in most of my Ecco shoes (even with removable insoles) because of this. Had to keep them anyway because Amazon wouldn't take a return... had one pair of deep volume boots by Seibel and they worked in that. (I used to use the black Superfeet on top of the removable insoles that came with the boots.)If your foot can handle the give, these may work for you.I mostly wear Ecco shoe styles that work well for people with low volume feet (Soft 7 and Bella), which may be why these didn't work with most of my shoes.If you have flat feet or feet that fall and your arches are not very high, the black Superfeet have a very low profile and work great. I can't recommend the black enough. (Though there's no padding in them. Some of us do better without padding. Padding aggravates my hypermobility and therefore my Morton's neuromas.)Hope this proves useful to people.As a long term sufferer with foot pain, these have been a blessed relief! I was diagnosed with Plantar-Fasciitis in both heels three years ago and as it didn't subside after a few months, and as the injections hadn't worked, I was told it was probably permanent. It seemed I would have to put up with the pain.I have tried many, many so called cures, gels, insoles, pressure socks, and yes, even magnets before, none of them worked. When I saw these advertised on Amazon, I sent for them more in hope than expectation.They arrived the next day, I cut them to size as described and put them into my shoes. In some of the write-ups I'd seen they said it had taken a while for them to work, so I was expecting a slow lead-in to any benefit. For me they started working within half an hour. First, I noticed my toes were not as painful as they usually were, a short while later I realised there was almost no pain in my heels.I almost didn't believe it, these insoles were actually working!!!If you have or know someone who has constant, long term foot pain, the £35 these cost is but a small price to pay for any form of relief.A couple of observations.Although the insoles do ease the pain considerably while standing/walking, the pain does seem to increase when you sit down and take the weight off your feet!! I don't know why, but for me it does.The pain increases when I take the shoes/insoles off! The pain calming effect only seems to work while you are wearing the insoles. Which is fair enough I suppose. No one claimed a complete cure.They worked for me and I will be purchasing more pairs, once I am certain they don't stop working before the twelve months they offer as a ""guide"" to how long they last. Hope this helps!The biggest problem I found was because of the high heel due to an added sole underneath the copper sole meant that I could not keep my heel in the shoe and my foot slipped out. So I now use them in my wellingtons and I have had to trim the toe end to get them to fit properly. An expensive purchase and I cannot return them as I have cut them.I have fused ankles and have several pairs of these insoles. They are very supportive and great for helping with my walking.I have arthritic feet and knees. I was recommended copper insoles by a fellow sufferer who firmly believes they are helping her…..I’ve only just started using these copper insoles (about 4 day’s) so far I believe they are helping my arthritic feet. They are not cheap but if they are helping me as I believe they are then they will have been worth every penny!

Even without a winch, it’s nice to have real recovery points up front. I did not add the grill guard. I figured I could down the road. But now I like it the way it is and might not.I used this on my 2019 Crosstrek.I disliked the wrench that came with the product. mounting the bar was difficult. so I used a 14mm open end wrench and an align key to tighten.It will weigh your front end down a little, other than that this bumper by Warn is amazing!This bumper is great! Easy to install if you have a couple hours and friend to help, especially if you follow the video on YouTube. Looks great and is very functional. Fits well with Primitive Racing skid plates. Wish the the pin holes for the D ring shackles were a larger diameter, because the ones on the bumper limit you to buying the Warn shackles or pretty plain, simple D rings. The bumper, bar and winch all work perfect from Warn. Can’t wait till they come out with the wireless remote for the winch.I’m completely happy with this. I had to send the 1st on back due to missing welds. Check it thoroughly. Install was straight forward. Looks fantastic!Great product. Easy installation. Fits perfectly.I'm going to be honest I was terrified to cut up the bumper on my 2020 Crosstrek but if you take your time and cut a little off at a time, it turns out just fine! Absolutely love this bumper qnd it gives it the off-road look I'm going for for my build! Got this as a gift and decided to post a review on Amazon since it probably gets more traffic than anywhere else. Great little bumper. It shown some signs of slight rust in places like the shackle mounts and the welds but I've been keeping an eye on it pretty often and when a new rust spot starts to pop up, I'll hit it with a wire brush and then spray flat black Rust-Oleum on it and it blends right in. All together, I couldn't be happier with this bumper. I'm still riding on stock suspension for now and the weight of the bumper doesn't seem to effect the ride quality or make the front end sag.

Sperry Top-Sider Leeward 2 Eye Boat Shoe,6pm Sperry Top-Sider Footwear RP,"Leeward 2-Eye Corduroy Boat Shoe Best known for boat shoes that have logged more miles of open ocean than any other brand, the Sperry Top-Sider story began on a raw winter day in New England. When avid sailor and hobbyist inventor Paul Sperry let his dog Prince out for his daily exercise, he noticed that the cocker spaniel was remarkably stable, even at a full run on the snow covered, icy crust. Paul raced back to his laboratory to begin working. Using pieces of rubber, a razor blade, and an ordinary sneaker, Paul had soon pieced together the prototype of the world's first boat shoe. Subsequent designs yielded the original Sperry Top-Sider now known as the Authentic Original. Since 1935, Sperry Top-Sider has been the leading brand of footwear for those who love the water. From its introduction of the world's first siped rubber outsole for non-marking traction, to its advanced technical fabrication to combat the elements, Sperry Top-Sider remains the vanguard of high-performance amphibious footwear. Available around the globe in fine independent, marine, and department stores, Sperry Top-Sider is the official footwear of the U.S. Sailing Team, Zodiac Academy, the World Billfish Series, and the Shimano Fishing Tour.","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Men"",""Shoes"",""Loafers & Slip-Ons""]",6pm Sperry Top-Sider Footwear RP,mens,"The text said it runs true to size but it doesn't.

The  drawer slides handle the weight with ease and the midi tray actually glides now!I will say I am having a little trouble getting one side to lock on the in position which I will admit could very well be user error from how I put the desk together :)  I really don't care enough to find out because the other side locks so it isn't noticeable.They are a little frustrating to line up but all drawer slides are and these at least lock so they don't keep popping out like cheap kind.I'll report back if anything changes but so stoked so far and very happy with these!","[""✔Original & Reliable --- VADANIA is one of the earliest sellers who bring this innovative heavy duty slides to the consumer market.

Fit perfect and works great. You can get a few of these for what Harley-Davidson charges for a battery.I thought this was a great price for a 360CCA gel battery but when I immediately tested it upon receipt the tester would only blink rapidly and shut off.. I tested two other (different configuration HD batteries) and neither of them made the tester flicker or shut off when connected.I noticed that one of the terminals (very thin metal folded at 90 degrees) was crooked coming out of the top and sticking out a bit more than the opposite terminal. I tried using my finger to push it in and it didn't move, but when I retested the battery the flickering continued but this time it gave me a reading of 12.8 volts. I ran the load test and it showed 360CCA so I went ahead and installed it into the 93 Sportster project and the bike started and ran fine. I've only started it a few times since then as of this writing..I'm a little skeptical that I won't become stranded on the side of the road because of this battery. We will see.....The OEM battery lasted a 2 years. I hope this battery will last longer.Great price for an excellent batteryI got the problem solved by going to Ace Hardware, but I shouldn't have had to do that.Seems to have good reviewsDid not come with nuts and boltsI bought this battery for a '93 custom Softail. Of all post-Shovelhead models, Softails are hardest on batteries because the battery's surrounded by a hot oil tank, plus pre-Twinkie ST models are rigid mounted, meaning more frame vibration than other models.That said, if you use a battery tender you can expect five years of life (or more) from a sealed battery.This one appears to be an exact copy of a Yuasa, meaning it's probably as good as any stock H-D battery or any of the hundred dollar batteries out there.

This interactive dog puzzle toy is great for dogs who crave a mentally stimulating brain teaser or to encourage slower eating habits in fast eaters.

If damage occurs, replace toy immediately. Intended for dogs only. Keep out of reach of children.","[""Pet Supplies"",""Dogs"",""Toys"",""Balls""]",Planet Dog,Pet Supplies,"Update: 11/13/16I've now had this just over two years and it is finally starting to show some wear on the edges of the funnel that is normally folded into the bowl. It still functions just fine, but there are a couple cracks at the edge. I bought a second one earlier this year as a replacement but haven't used it yet. I decided, tonight, that I'd throw out the old one next trash night. lol  In my original review, I mentioned that I pick the dispenser up immediately after she finishes eating.  It's been clear that she isn't going to massacre it, so I'm not as vigilant at picking it up. Sometimes, she'll have it all day while I'm at work.  She'll greet me at the door with it hanging from her mouth while her butt wiggles in greeting.  It's quite the sight. A bubble-headed, wiggle butt.Love this!  I haven't found anything I like better.*Original Post*I really love this treat/food dispenser. My dog gulps her food and has some other behavioral issues. A different treat dispenser was recommended by a trainer and I wasn't impressed with that one. So I did some research and came across this one. I already have the Orbee Diamond Plate ball which my dog has been unable to destroy over several months (and she destroys most balls within minutes). Already impressed with Orbee, I decided to give this dispenser a shot.Based on the reviews, I knew this could be destroyed as it's not meant to be a chew toy. Generally, as soon as my dog is done eating, I remove the dispenser. However, there have been several occasions where I haven't done so, and she has not chewed it up. I don't know why, but once she gets all the food from it, she's done with it and leaves it alone.  I'm not complaining because it's too expensive to keep buying them.The first few tips of the dispenser will offer a rather generous payload, but I see that as a good thing as that initial success keeps her trying--even when there are only one or two pieces of kibble to get out at the end. Because this is a soft material, it is flexible and provides some decent bounce. It's quite fun to watch her grip it in her teeth (it looks like some bubble-head muzzle when she does this), lift her head, and slam it to the ground to bounce out the stubborn kibble at the end. She's also discovered that if she gets on the sofa or bed, it drops farther and has more impact thereby dislodging any kibble that might get stuck in the tiny hole on the bottom.  It's good fun to watch her antics and nice to know that she isn't gulping her food.  It normally takes her between 15-20 minutes to get every last piece out versus the 2-3 minutes when she inhales it out of a bowl.I mentioned the tiny hole at the bottom. I was concerned that the smaller pieces of kibble would trickle out. My dog eats Blue Buffalo with Lifesource Bits.  The Bits are very tiny (smaller than a pea) and would easily fit through the small hole; however, this does not appear to be the case. Generally, a larger kibble will get wedged in the hole and prevents the smaller one from getting out that way. My dog gets 1 to 1.25 cups of food twice a day (depending on her activity levels), and I have had no trouble fitting either of those quantities in the dispenser.  As I already mentioned, the first few rolls of the dispenser will eject a higher payload and the more food I put in, the higher the initial payoff.Some reviewers have complained about the dispenser gathering a lot of carpet fuzz and dust bunnies. This is true. I run the dispenser through very hot water every other day after she eats in the morning and by her night time feeding, it's dry. Then about twice a week, I add dish detergent and shake it up to clean it really well.Food is easy to put in this. The plastic (or whatever material it is) is folded down in so it's more of a half-moon ball. When it's on the flat side, it challenges the dog to figure out how to roll it back to the bouncier, rounder side.  Anyhow, the folded down part can be rolled out and functions as a tube through which I add the food. Then I just roll it back in on itself and voila! 15-20 minutes of food and fun.Because of the material, this is quite a quiet dispenser which is nice when I have to feed the dog at 5:30 in the morning and don't want to wake up the rest of the house. I have tile, laminate flooring and carpeting, so she can transition amongst the three without any major noise difference.I've had this for a couple months now, and she still loves it, and it is holding up quite well. Again, despite being a chewer, she seems to leave this alone once she gets the food out (It appears I'm lucky in this).","[""Interactive treat-dispensing dog puzzle ball"",""Adds a mentally stimulating aspect to playtime as dogs roll and bounce the ball to release treats from the maze inside"",""Great as a slow feeder with kibble to help slow eating pace and help improve digestion"",""Made with Orbee-Tuff material that is tough yet gentle on dogs' teeth"",""Think N' Thrive dog enrichment toys provide mental stimulation for dogs, help relieve dog anxiety, and provide both mental and physical exercise; just 15 minutes of mental stimulation is equal to 30 minutes of physical activity""]"

It looks even more tan in person than in the photo.I ordered grey but the color is more of a tan. I really wanted grey but will make due.

The yellow is a beautiful pale buttery yellow. It is not as bright/saturated as it appears in the advertisement picture.Love this blanket! I bought it specifically to coordinate with the crib sheet that I had bought for my Baby Girl. It’s not a super soft blanket, but it’s not rough by any means. Because it’s the material that it is, I didn’t buy it for softness. It’s pretty stretchy, but I don’t want it to lose its shape. And it’s light weight but has enough weight for comfort. Overall, it was a great purchase! 10/10 would recommendLOVE the blanket so far- great knit and quality- washed up and dried easily and well. I almost feel bad knocking off a star but as another reviewer noted, the green color is different than the photos, not as muted or dark. Also there is a brand tag on it which I don’t love, but that is shown in the photos so I expected that.

I think the trick is the combo of width and length.

So it seems if I get the wider one, then I don't need the same length.  A bit of trial and error.  So although these are slightly too big and my heel rides up a bit, other than that they are extremely supportive and comfortable.

That's why our mission is to seek out the best herbs the earth has to give. It's the way we deliver uncompromising quality and help you live healthier.","[""Health & Household"",""Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements"",""Digestive Supplements"",""Dietary Fibers""]",‏  ‎ Nature's Way,‏  ‎ Size 7 oz,"GoodI've heard and researched the benefits of beet root. I would rather have the fresh vegetable, but I totally lacks availability and convenience, hence the supplement. I looked for a particular strength and a roundabout price range. This is the first I've tired a beet root supplement and I have no complaints, thus far. But then, I really don't know what to expect from it either.I initially added an Omega-3 (with CoQ10, DHA, EPA, and L-Carnitine Fumarate) formula to the supplements I take, then later this Beet Root product. I added Beet Root because research has indicated that it dialates the blood vessels, lowering blood pressure and allowing for increased oxygen intake (and an according boost in energy) when exercising. My blood pressure readings have been almost, but not quite, at the pre-hypertension level.I bicycle, and run on an elliptical. After two months of Omega-3 plus one month of this Beet Root, I'm able to put forth an additional effort. I am able to ride about 5% faster on my bike, and run about 5% faster on the elliptical. I haven't extended my bicycle rides, or run for longer periods on the elliptical. I'm riding the same distance and running for the same time as before. And I'm just as tired when my exercise is over ;) But I am able to go about 5% faster.Sometimes there is a ""placebo effect"". You think you should improve, so you do even though the supplement is worthless. But having tried a different CoQ10 + L-Carnitine Fumarate supplement recently that did absolutely NOTHING for me - advertised as an energy booster, but I got ZERO boost - I think I can identify whether this supplement truly makes a difference or is a waste of money.I noticed an initial slight improvement with the Omega-3 (about 2.5%), then an additional slight improvement (another 2.5%) when I added this Beet Root. Considering my recent experience with the other supplement that did nothing for me, I doubt I'm experiencing a ""placebo effect"" with what I'm taking now.So, I feel slightly, but noticeably, stronger since adding these supplements. I'm purchasing this Beet Root supplement through Amazon's 'subscribe and save' program. I'm going to continue my subscription.Update, April 4, 2012: I had my first doctor's appointment since adding this supplement. Doc took my BP, I asked what it was, and his response was ""excellent"", which is something I haven't heard in years. Maybe this supplement gets some credit, maybe not, but what I'm doing is obviously working and I'm not going to change. I will continue my subscription.Update #2, September 25, 2012: Just came from my second doctor's appointment (I go every 6 months). BP again low.It's been about 7 months since I wrote my initial review. I feel even stronger today. The weather this summer was great for cycling, and that was 95% of my exercise. Over the summer, I slowly increased the length and speed at which I ride (today: 25% further and 10% faster). I also notice improved strength otherwise: I mow my lawn (push mower) faster; not having to re-fill the gas tank is proof. If I go for a lunchtime walk with co-workers, when we hit a steep hill I notice my heart rate and breathing are less affected than they were before. Etc.Note that I take other supplements: a multi-vitamin, the above-mentioned Omega-3 supplement, and others. I watch what I eat as well. I don't know how much credit this particular supplement should get overall. I can tell you that the combination of diet, exercise, and supplements, including this supplement, works for me.This will be my last update to this review unless I learn something negative about this supplement. Best of luck to you in reaching your health goals.Been on blood pressure meds as long as I can remember, here lately I’ve had to monitor my blood pressure for 2 weeks… after getting enough in my system I can say my blood pressure went from ranging 140/90-100+ I’m now staying around 130/80-95. Definitely worth the buyI have been trying methodically to lower my blood pressure for the past 6 months or so using various supplements.Actually I have tried a dozen or more supplements including the ones listed in by Robert Kowalaski in his book. I take my own blood pressure reading at the same time daily and add notes to a wonderful and fun-to-use blood pressure iPhone app called Codulis. It is great for graphing results and gives stats including AVERAGES of BP readings over days, weeks, months, etc. This is very important since blood pressure can vary over time. I find a lot of people give recommendations based on a few readings which can be VERY misleading and inaccurate. For the past 2 or 3 months I have watched my average blood pressure reading and mapped BP graph gradually and consistently slope downward. My blood pressure average at the beginning 5 months ago was a high systolic average of 157 with diastolic of around 83 - with spikes of 170 systolic or more at times. My average systolic readings gradually started to go down monthly to 152, 145 and now I have average systolic readings for the past month of 138/72. For my routine, I take two of the olive leaf capsules by Life extension, 2 Natures way beet root capsules 3x a day and I also take one cup of low sodium V8 juice with a VERY small amount of Now Potassium chloride (about 1/4 tsp). I also try to practice deep breathing and walk a mile or more per day. Although I am adding other supplements and making some life style changes, I have concluded that the olive extract is a large factor in lowering my BP especially in conjunction with the beet root capsules. I have yet to have any side effects from this regimen other than some loose stools on occasion. By the way, olive oil has recently been isolated in the Mediterranean diet as THE ingredient responsible for the lower risk of strokes and CVD in those countries. The primary mechanism is believed to be the blood pressure lowering ability of the oleuropein in the olive oil (and olive leaf extract). I have increased my olive oil consumption but the olive leaf extract is easier to take on a consistent basic. The beet root capsules have an added benefit of not only lowering blood pressure but helping men with ED!","[""Beet Root contains sugars and starches that make it a source of energy.*"",""Our Beet is carefully tested and produced to superior quality standards"",""Gluten-Free"",""No salt, yeast, wheat, soy, corn, dairy products, artificial colors, flavors or preservatives."",""Safety sealed with printed outer shrink-wrap and inner seal.

Los calambres en las piernas pararonOverall good qualityI have been a long time user of Magnesium and Potassium. Without them I get really bad muscle cramps and tingly hands and feet. Normally I take a Magnesium pill and a potassium pill. Two pills. So, the reason I purchased this product was so that I only had to take one pill per day instead of two, and it was double the dose that I usually took, and had the added benefit of calcium. Once they arrived I realized to get the full dose on the label, I actually needed to take two pills. Which kind of ruined the reason I even bought them. But I lucked out because 1 of these was actually the exact dose I was on when taking a separate magnesium and potassium supplement. So, from day one I took one of these per day, which was exactly the dosing of what I was taking before, which was enough to end my muscle cramps and tingly hands and feet for a good 6 month period. Well, a month of taking this supplement, and I am back to constant muscle cramps and tingly hands and feet. This supplement is doing nothing at all. Very disappointing. I am going to change back to my old supplements that are two separate pills, one for magnesium and one for potassium.

It has a classy professional look to it. Love that it’s adjustable, can you it for any occasion and poster size.Pro tip: make sure your poster is thick enough to stand on its own, or it will bend/curve in the display.Great stand for the price. We use it to display posters for church events.I use it for my paracord shop. It's the perfect size!It arrived broken*Update 3/11/22*I am late updating this but they immediately sent out another and it was perfect! 5 stars for customer service!I bought three of these sign holders for pop up outlet stores that I was opening for a temporary timeframe. This was just for added advertisement in the window to show images of the clothing brands we are selling, because the Landlord wouldn't allow images on the actual window. This sign holder is working perfectly for us. I produced a 36""W x 72""H image on foamcore, and the sign holder grasps it top and bottom holding it securely in place. It was easy for our retail associates to assemble and the price, at just under $46 was awesome. Great value for the cost! I would definitely buy these again if I need something like it in the future.EDIT 3-4-2019: since my first review the seller reached out and offered to replace all the stands. The new stands arrived without missing hardware and without damage. They were packed MUCH better this time around which likely is the cause for that. They're still lower quality than what I'd like and a bit flemsy. The screws to tighten the uprights and cross bars are pretty cheap and the plastic thumb screw caps broke on the old ones so I'll likely just go to the hardware store and buy some new ones there so the same doesn't happen with these replacement stands.They'll work for some of the lighter weight display items like posterboard and banners, but we will have to get something more sturdy for the heavier frames and canvas prints.ORIGINAL: Bought these as the first stands I purchased were extremely cheap. These, although metal, are built very poorly. The thumbscrew caps on the tightening bolts stripped off already, one arrived bent since there's no proper packing material in the box. Of the three I ordered only one is somewhat decent!After a slight item mix up due to the item appearing to be used we returned it and requested an exchange. The seller was prompt with shipping and we received the brand new one without any issues.The quality was nice and the best feature was the easy set up and how the stand can be adjusted based on the size of your poster/sign. It has a sturdy base that helps prevent it from tipping over. So far it has held up great for being outdoors and in a location that has strong gusts of wind. “This poster stand works extremely well and is easily adjusted to accommodate various sizes of signage. I originally purchased two stands for the building I work in. We use them to hold posters advertising events. We were so impressed with them that I ordered an additional eight stands a few days later to use throughout the building. They are easy to assemble - it takes less than two minutes per stand. Although they do have a heavy base, I don't think I would use them outside, as they would likely get blown over in the wind. I'm sure there are heavier duty options out there, but for the money, this has been a great solution.","[""★ Poster Stand Pole: The pole uses advanced technology and manufacturing techniques, first polished, and then spray paint."",""★ Height Adjustment: The screw at the bracket can adjust the height, and it can be moved up and down according to the needs of the size.

Next page","[""Industrial & Scientific"",""Test, Measure & Inspect"",""Electrical Testing"",""Current Testers"",""Clamp Meters""]",‏  ‎ AstroAI,,"Needed a more versatile multi-meter but couldn't afford a ""big name"" brand. Saw this one being used by a mechanic I subscribe to on youtube and ordered it on Amazon. Got here in a few days and works great! I'm impressed..It came with one dead, corroding battery but that had not damaged the contacts. I replaced them with cells from the LED flashlight in my bag, which was not really all that bright anymore, and it would time out - go blankscreen after a few seconds. Found some better batteries and measured the ones I had tried, and they were at 0.87 volts. With decent batteries it seems to be reliable, giving the same voltage and current readings as my FLUKE 377 that cost almost 10X as much. The 20 amp current scale overloads on a 17.9 amp load, so you switch to the 200 amp scale and it reads correctly. I got it so my farmer friends can troubleshoot their electrical stuff - mostly fans and pumps and timers and circuit breakers and heating elements and thermostats - all stuff that was not designed to operate in an environment as damp as a greenhouse - and I have high hopes that it will turn out to be just what they needed. Basically test 1 is ""is there voltage on both sides of the 240 line?"" and test 2 is ""if yes, is it drawing about the right current?""I am not a fan of the tiny screw that holds the battery door in place, but I like the wasy the battery tray snaps into place. I assume the screw will get replaced with some duct tape as part of the next battery change, after someone loses the screw. Arrived on time, no complaints from me on this purchase, at least so far. The farmers have it now :)Very useful instrument and easy to read.works great - very good product - use the A/C Amp clip 85% of the time - Update 5/16/18I see from many of the questions asked that there is not a clear understanding what this meter does, I bought this a couple of months ago and use it often - it is a great product especially for the price which is incredible for how well it works, accuracy and features / functionality.To clear up many questions (any many INCORRECT ANSWERS!!) The meter performs the following measurements:Voltage measured using supplied Red & Black Test leads -A/C volts from 0 to 750 VAC - Range settings for AC volts - 600mV, 6V, 60V, 600V, 750VD/C Volts - (YES it measures DC volts like for Batteries) - 0 to 1000 VDC - Range settings for DC Volts - 600mV, 6V, 60V, 600V, 1000VCurrent - Measured in Amperes - using the integrated Clamp - Measures A/C Current (AMPs) ONLY does not measure DC CurrentFirst - to measure A/C current you must separate the Neutral and Hot (typically Neutral is the White and Hot is Black) then open the clamp, place around either the Hot or Neutral wire, won't work if you place clamp around both wires together (like around a lamp cord wire), you have to isolate/separate these 2 wires in order to read AC current. Once clamp is around (wire is inside clamp area) wire, then close clamp - wire should be loose inside clamp area. There are many ways you can do this - ""google"" how to use a clamp A/C current meter and u should find descriptions, YouTube videos etc.. they all work the same way (different brands).A/C Current (measured in AMPS) - Range settings - 60A, 600A, 1000A (meter cannot read small values - e.g. Milli-amps - mA or <1 Amp)A/C Frequency (measured in Hertz) - using Clamp - Range Setting - 50 to 1KHz (1,000 Hz), Using Red/Black Test Leads - Range - 0 - 60MHz (60,000,000 Hz). Also Measures ""Duty Cycle"" - Range - 0.01 to 99.9% This function is switchable from Frequency setting.Measuring RESISTANCE, CONTINUITY, CAPACITANCE - uses Red & Black Test LeadsResistance - (in Ohms) - Range 0 to 60MOhms (60,000,000 Ohms) - Range Settings - 600, 6K, 60K, 600K, 6M, 60M OhmsContinuity (detects open or short circuit - sounds beep when shorted)Capacitance - (in Farads) - Range - 60nF to 20mF, Range settings - 60nF, 600nF, 6uF, 60uF, 400uF, 20mFDiodes - Measures continuity of DiodesTemperature - Uses Special Temperature Test Leads - White (included) - plugs into special jack (same one as Resistance, Capacitance, Frequency, Continuity, Diode) and Common jack - Range -40 degrees C to 1740 degrees C, or -40 Degrees F to 2000 Degrees Fahrenheit - White leads have a temperature sensor on tip that is used to measure temp - you can change from F to C by pushing buttonA/C CurrentO.k.OK the meter and amp clamp for AC seems great ! the only problem i very seldom need to know AC amps , i misread the description , thought it was a DC amp clamp also it is not a DC amp clamp ! not there fault it is mine ! all the other features i like , still need a DC amp clamp for working on autos or cars how ever you wish to say it !Product is very easy to use but texture can be compelling.I LOVE THIS, IF YOUR INTO CAR AUDIO, YOU NEED THIS. IF YOU DO CAR REPAIRS YOU NEED THIS. THIS IS A GREAT TOOL TO HAVE AND WORKS GREAT.I wouldn't buy another one, prefer a normal meter layout. Fidly dial to select different things and not the clearest of displays unless backlight is on.great to have in tool box works well so farHere I have listed its pros and cons of AstroAI Digital Clamp Meter:Pros:- Very convenient to measure voltage-amperage, resistance etc of any electrical/electronic devices- LED backlight makes it easy to read temperature in dark areas- Very useful to test the voltage, ampere and resistance etc during renovations- Large clamp makes it useful to have it in cars which comes in handy at times- Battery indicator is very useful to let us know when to replace the battery- Holds data for the last reading- Auto switches off to conserve battery life- Did not experience any overheating problems- Durable build- Reliable till dateCons:- None as of nowImprovements suggested:- NoneThings to know before buying:- NAI will continue to use this Digital Clamp Meter in the coming days and will update this review if I find any other issues.

Also no issues with label coming off backing when put through a typewriter (yes I still have one) as some other inferior labels do. Seems like Avery is using a little heavier paper around the border of the label sheets (blue stripe) so feeding is improved over older boxes of labels. Happy so far.Great for mailing labels. These are the only ones I use for work.Nothing to dislike. Works as it shouldI use these to generate mailing labels from MS Excel data sources. Via MS Word Mail Merge Manager, I'm able to handle content of almost any length -- long names, long or complicated street addresses, two line addresses when required, plus city, state, mail code, even country. 1 x 4s 20 up on a sheet allows for such addresses, with rarely a need to edit down. Smaller Avery labels (30 up on a sheet) may look more economical, but typically require considerable editing to compromise for lack of longitudinal space.OEM material so works as you would expect. Works as advertised. Pleased with purchase so I'd purchase again.The labels are fine - the peel easily and stick well. My issue is the actual printing.I downloaded the Avery Wizard, as well as used the preset matching template in Word to print address labels for my mass HOA mailing. I wasted 9 sheets because they kept printing over on the next label even though they showed as centered on the template grids in both the Word labels and the Avery Wizard. Ran the test sheet twice on my Samsung laser printer and then on my HP inkjet to see if it was a printer issue - same results. Ended up adjusting them manually on the template to where they looked terrible, but printed well enough that I could actually use them.For what it's worth - i've been printing labels for YEARS and have had no issues - Avery, generic, you name it. I have not used these specific labels prior to purchasing this package. I have never had such a problem printing before. I likely will not purchase this particular label again.I have been using Avery labels for my Christmas card list for many years now. Love the convenience and quality.Very easy to use.

The vari-tooth design has variable tooth spacing and gullet capacity to provide faster cutting rates than the regular tooth design and to make smooth cuts. The teeth are made of M-42 high-speed steel for heat and wear resistance. The blade can make cuts in solid shapes, rectangular tubes, structural shapes, and sheets. It has a flexible back that is good for contoured cutting. The blade has a vari-raker tooth set, which alternates between left-leaning, right-leaning, and unset teeth. The variable pitch reduces noise levels and vibrations, and removes chips efficiently. Band saw blades are long, continuous bands of metal that loop around the wheels of band saws and can make straight or curved cuts in metal, wood, stone, plastic, and other materials. When purchasing band saw blades, consider the application, as this will affect the tooth rake, tooth set, pitch, and size of the blade. Band saw blades are available with a positive rake angle or a straight (also called zero) rake angle, and with a raker, wavy, or alternate tooth set. Pitch (the number of teeth per inch or per 25.4 mm) affects the type of finish and may be constant or variable. Band saw blades are available in different lengths and widths to fit the requirements of specific band saws. Lenox manufactures hand tools, band saw blades, and power tool accessories. The company, founded in 1915, is headquartered in Atlanta, GA.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Power & Hand Tools"",""Power Tool Parts & Accessories"",""Saw Blades, Parts & Accessories"",""Blades"",""Band Saw Blades""]","LENOX, Newell Rubbermaid",,"I hope this is helpful to others, so they do not make the same mistake as me.  If you own a wood-cutting band saw, and you attempt to cut metal on it, you WILL be disappointed !  I went to LENOX's website to determine which blade was appropriate for cutting 440 C stainless.  The Diemaster 2, Vari-Raker was listed.  I installed it, tensioned, adjusted, and broke-in according to instructions.  I Used CRC SL2512 oil to help cut and increase my blade life.  I could not even make it 1-inch !  After a call to the technical support at LENOX, the technician asked me which saw I was using (I own a Rigid 14-inch with 93.5"" blade), and he told me ""that's your problem"".  To CORRECTLY use this blade, I have to have a cutting rate of 120 Feet Per Minute (FPM) or less.  My band saw blade rotates at about 10 times that !  As a result, it simply burned its way through the metal.  So BE WARNED - use this blade on a METAL CUTTING band saw, and you will love it (excellent steel, excellent website, and EXCELLENT technical support at LENOX).  Use it on a wood-cutting band saw, and you will be writing a review like this one (UNLESS you can vary the blade rotation speed to the correct rate). (I wish they would have put a warning in the description for feed rate and blade speed...it would prevent A LOT of this type of problem).",null

From the Manufacturer This is a Genuine Replacement Part,The Model Number and Name for The Following Item:Whirlpool (WHIRA) W10190415 Silverware Basket","[""Appliances"",""Parts & Accessories"",""Dishwasher Parts & Accessories"",""Baskets""]",Whirlpool,,"My dishwasher is a 2005 KitchenAid model KUDS01FLSS6.  The original silverware basket developed a hole in the bottom allowing silverware to fall through below the bottom of the basket, so I wanted to replace it.  However, the original part is no longer available.  The Whirlpool W10190415 is a suitable replacement, as it fits exactly.  It comes with the fold-down lids for all the compartments, so it is ready to install as-is.  Note the original had a convenient, thicker handle and a decorative metal strip along the top length of the basket opposite the handle, which the replacement part does not have.I really liked the original handle as it is sturdy and easy to grip, so I decided to install it on the new basket.  Here's how I did it:I removed the two-piece plastic handle from the old basket by removing two screws.  To install it on the new part, I needed to drill two holes in the new basket where the screw posts fit.  It was easy and took just a few minutes to do this: I placed one of the two halves of the old handle -- the piece where the screws came out of -- and used the 2 screw holes as a drill template.  Using a small bit that fit in the screw holes without enlarging them, I drilled through the new basket.  Then I removed the template piece and used a larger bit (5/16"") to drill out the smaller holes in the basket.  The basket plastic was soft enough to make drilling easy and clean-up a snap.  Then I assembled the old handle on the new basket and installed in the dishwasher.  Voila!  Good as new.","[""The W10190415 is a genuine OEM Whirlpool Silverware Basket."",""The Whirlpool W10190415 is gray in color."",""The Whirlpool W10190415 Silverware Basket rests in the lower dishrack and holds small utensils such as forks and knives during the dishwashing cycle."",""The Whirlpool W10190415 replaces part numbers W10190415, 8531282, and 8562044."",""Whirlpool factory certified appliance parts are genuine high quality replacement parts made to exact specifications.""]"

They have been bright, quiet and reliable.NOTE: This bulb needs to turned on and burned 6-8 hours straight to (burn in). Before burning in, the light is overly yellow. After burning in, it appears to be 2700K, the same as incandescent bulbs. It's close enough in color that my cameras indicate it's incandescent light. And...It takes about a minute for the bulb to warm up and produce full illumination. I didn't think that was a positive thing at first and then realized it was a benefit to not be looking at the lamp switch when a full 250 Watt of light was switched on.In my case, I converted my reading chair, desk and bed side lamps over to hold this bulb. This generally requires that you start with a full size table lamp that holds a larger shade (the size used for 250 Watt incandescent bulbs). Those are getting rare now. I usually take the lamp apart and remove the spacer below the socket, shorten the internal threaded rod and install a new black Bakelite socket (not the flimsy brassy ones). You will also need a 11.5"" harp and a wide set harp mount (the normal narrow harp mount won't work). I've seen these parts at Home Depot and/or custom lamp shops.The old lamp shade may have to be changed to accommodate the new bulb. Save the old lamp spacer in case technology catches up and high watt bulbs get smaller again. When everything is right, the switch should be just below the lower lamp shade, and the upper lamp shade should prevent you from looking at the bulb when walking by.Not including the bulb or lamp shade, expect conversion cost to be $15-$20 for the Bakelite switch, harp and harp base. If you cut the hollow threaded rod (pipe) that holds the lamp together TOO SHORT, that's also available, but be prepared to spend $10 for a length of it.","[""10000 Average rated hours"",""65-Watt medium base"",""5000K natural light bulb"",""Energy Saver""]"
Flash Furniture 5' W x 3' H Magnetic Marker Board,Flash Furniture,"Life is so busy these days and everyone could use some help keeping up. This magnetic marker board will help you keep track of those receipts for your expense report, remind you about your 2 o'clock meeting and that you need to leave early to take the kids to the dentist. This dry erase board is perfect for classrooms, conference rooms, kid's playrooms, offices, scheduling, game night and many other activities. Dry erase boards offer a fun way to engage people. The lacquer painted white board surface resists scratching and erases easily without ghosting. This marker board features an accessory tray with rubber stopper for markers and erasers, and includes a magnetized surface to attach notes or items. The galvanized aluminum frame adds stability to last throughout the years. No matter what you use it for, this dry erase board is just the ticket to help you stay organized.","[""Office Products"",""Office & School Supplies"",""Presentation Boards"",""Dry Erase Boards""]",‎Flash Furniture,,"The product is pretty good, especially comparing to other products that have a much higher price tag. It comes with anchors and screws although you can use other ""no-drilling"" solutionsThis is a good whiteboard and easy to install with 2 people. The product first arrived damaged with a crease down the middle. The company was very helpful and fast with a replacement. Happy with the whiteboard.It's perfect for the price but it's dented. The box has a damage. I will keep it.Bought it for the office because it was bigger than the one we had. And we all know bigger is better.It passed my ""no swear install test"", meaning cursing was at an absolute 0 when I put it up. Super easy. Did need a friend to help keep it level while putting it up, but that makes sense because of the size.No scratches or dings. Sturdy. Included hardware was fine. Win in my book.Bought this for my 9th grade daughter for Christmas and she loves it! It is a bit awkward to install - you definitely need 2 people, but the result is well worth it. It is a little tough to get the metal tray to slide on - it seems to hang on the plastic at the beginning - but persevere!!! It will eventually squeeze past the difficult spot with a little wriggling and clearing of shaved plastic. The magnets she uses on it have also been used on our fridge, and they don't seem to stick as tightly on the board, but they are certainly strong enough to hang papers and other light items. My daughter uses it for homework, and has actually written out math problems on the board and then took pictures with her phone and sent them to her math teacher to show her work! I leave notes for her on it, and she and her friends do artwork. It really was well worth the $60 I spent, which was WAY less than all the other boards out there. It arrived on time and undamaged.Originally, I gave this product a poor review. Turns out there is a protective covering of clear plastic. If you fail to remove this covering, the plastic will degrade after repeated use/cleaning, giving the appearance of poor quality.I thought it was a plastic enamel, but I was mistaken. Over all, this is a decent board. It came with a very small dent in the front, or I would have given a 5-star rating.Damaged on arrivalAs others have mentioned, the sheer size of this board makes it difficult to ship, and therefore more susceptible to abuse en-route. The back side of my board is completely buckled from seam to seam, however it doesn't seem to affect the stability or evenness of the front side (the wipe-off surface). As I had no plans for mounting the defect doesn't matter all that much.The magnetic surface is strong enough for my child's learning tools and the wipe off surface cleans easily.Over all, I wish I'd purchased a product with zero flaws but appreciate that I only spent $80 for a huge board delivered to my door. The convenience of not having to wrangle this in and out of an SUV is reason enough for me to recommend this product to others.Looks a good product with a good size. Originally I used 3'*4' board but changed to this size. Mounting method is poor compared with many other similar products. It is not a one man job. It used four standalone brackets, two each on top and the bottom to hold the board. The measurement between the top and bottom brackets is H (Board height) + 2mm The brackets should come with a slot hole to allow for bigger variance. Normally, you can hold the board after setting up the top brackets but not this one. All four brackets have to be in place and by using four self tap screws to hold the board. Very poor mounting design. I will not buy if I know it.I bought this whiteboard to do some planning and organize my life. Overall I can say this whiteboard is worth it IF YOU ARE SOMEWHAT KF A HANDY MAN/WOMAN. The setup was a pain because the instructions are basically useless. After that, it has been a VERY reliable and sturdy whiteboard.Pros:- Erases really good, doesn't leave marks behind- Very strong and durable- The included marker holder is decent- It's magnetic which is a big plusCons:- Was NOT easy to set up- The included screws could have been betterI still would recommend this to anyone who wants a decent board.Didn’t ship for quite a while which bugged me. It arrived with badly damaged packaging but that’s not the seller’s fault. I also ship my items with Purolator and they damage mine too. There were no instructions which meant searching you tube for help from other manufacturers. That bugged me too. The item itself is fantastic and I would endorse it completely. I use it for my woodshop and my daughter draws on it daily. Great product.price for size these are the best things going.. way cheaper than ones half the size at brick and mortar.. comes with hardware, and looks sharp and clean on the wallThis board is perfect. Probably the least expensive you will find anywhere for the size and features(magnetic, marker tray). I use half for doing homework questions/brainstorming and the other half for to-do/schedule and there's still enough space.","[""When you need to make a point and words just aren't getting the job done, having a dry erase board in the room can be a lifesaver.

I have slightly acidic well water and it was starting to corrode the tank from the inside out. I went with a figerglass tank and larger for less pump cycling. When I went to drain the tank I couldn't get any water out of it. The tank tee was completely clogged up. Could not drain the tank but also helped me pin point my water pressure problems as well. The tank would not accept any water. When I tried to move the tank it was extremely heavy.  I had to tip the tank over and roll it. I tipped it over so it was upside down and open the bottom. The tank had some water in it but was full of sand. Had to scoop it out to be able to move the tank. So I installed a filter on the pipes before the tank to catch sand and sediment.  I had also been having issues with my water softener head getting clogged up. I went with the 5 micron filter to catch the smallest particles.  So glad I did. After the 1st month of use this is the filter looked like when I changed it.,null

I tried both their 5 and 5.5 slippers and the 5.5 was too big. The 5 fit me like a dream--no heel slippage (which is normally my biggest issue).I had no problems with them being too tight at first, but I do have pretty narrow feet. I wasn't able to slip them on and off at all for the first two months or so (had to use my hand to help put them on).After about two months of daily wear around the house and in the backyard with our puppy, they stretched/ flattened out enough that I can slip them on easily most of the time now. They are still pretty comfortable too.The only negative about them is I've noticed that the arches of my feet start to hurt (especially on the inside of my foot) if I walk around with these on for more than 30 minutes straight. Not sure why as they are solidly made and nothing is poking me, and they do seem to have decent support. I don't have flat feet and I've never had this issue with any other shoes I've owned. So I assume it's the slippers causing this.I'm overall pretty happy with these slippers though. They meet my needs for an indoor/outdoor slipper for tiny feet.

Yo no lo recomoendo estoy decepcionado 😞 siento que me an estafado.Wasn't waterproof like it's supposed to beI have been looking for a new smartwatch for a while and came across this one. I am so happy I was able to order it. It arrived on time and was packaged well. It came with a charging cable and an instruction booklet. The band is made of soft silicone and is very comfortable on the wrist. The screen display is great to; bright and easy to read, (great for incoming text messages, calls, and emails)! There is even a sedentary reminder that alerts me to get up and walk around. Great feature of being at work in front of the pc all day. The watch charged right up for a few hours and set up was super easy!

When I first got it l, like 3 days ago, I tried making phone calls with the watch and it worked. I can hear the other person clearly and the other person has no problem with hearing me too,, just like a bluetooth. The only bad thing about it is that you have to be close to your phone, otherwise it won't stay connected. The other features work good as well accept that the steps counters are off. For 8 hours of my work day, I walked all over the hospital and my step goal is set to 10k, however, it never reached that goal. My other step counters reach my 10k goal plus more, but not my watch. Yesterday and today, I noticed that the touch screen is acting up. When I lift my arm up to look at the time, the screen will jump to another screen and so forth. It's like it has a mind of its own. It seems to delay in responding when I swipe or just acting up. Also I haven't been getting my notifications for my text messages, even though I have set it to receiving it.

"Sigma BC 14.16 STS Digital Wireless Bicycle Computer w/Optional Cadence | Altitude Functions - Slope, Gradient | Android Phone Pairing | Full Text Display, Auto Start/Stop | IPX8 Water Resistant",Sigma,"Calling All Hill Climbers! The BC 14.16 STS is the perfect computer for attacking the hills. Enhanced altitude measuring functions include an altitude profile graph and current gradient. Using NFC technology and the free SIGMA LINK app, the BC14.16 STS can communicate with Android smartphones to program and download ride data. Available in a wired, an STS wireless and an STS double wireless version (wireless speed and cadence).   Over 14 functions The more than 14 functions of the BC 14.16 STS are clearly and partly graphically displayed on the large dot matrix display screen. In addition to the classic bike functions, the BC 14.16 STS has six altitude features and in the STS CAD variant, two cadence functions. High-percentage In addition to the classic altimeter functions, the BC 14.16 STS also shows the altitude profile and the ascent percentages.   NFC & Sigma Link The BC 14.16, BC 16.16 and BC 23.16 models can communicate directly with an Android smartphone via NFC (near field communication). To do so, you must install the free SIGMA LINK app. For wireless data exchange, simply hold your smartphone up to the computer. The app can be used to change settings and read trip data. The data can be transferred from the smartphone into the DATA CENTER via the SIGMA CLOUD. Conversely, it is also possible to transfer data from the DATA CENTER onto the smartphone via the CLOUD. The free SIGMA LINK app is available in the app store and Google Play store. The NFC technology is only available for Android smartphones.   Trip Section Timer Due to the integrated trip section timer, partial sections of an overall trip can be separately entered manually. Thus, the evaluation of a partial section or interval workout is made possible, without affecting the total values of the trip. Temperature Display All models from the BC 14.16/STS/CAD to the BC 23.16 have a temperature indicator. This shows the current temperature of your environment at all times.         Adjustable Wheel Sizes Got more than one bike? Two wheel sizes can be programmed into the BC14.16 to separate ride data. The STS wireless versions automatically switch between bike 1 or bike 2 based on the transmitter signal. Predefined Tire Sizes Setting the wheel size is extremely easy using the tire size. From 16 inches to 700C to 29 inches, the wheel size can be set easily using predefined tire sizes. Of course, it is also possible to manually enter the wheel size in millimetres. Speed Comparison The BC14.16 STS continuously compares current and average speed. When there is a difference, the result is indicated by an upward or downward arrow. Workout Statistics for 12 Months In addition to total values, the BC14.16 STS keeps track of statistics for the last twelve months. The “workout diary” helps compare and analyze monthly activities. Integrated Storage Chip Thanks to an integrated memory chip in the computer head unit, all the total values and settings are permanently stored in the device. After changing the battery, you therefore only need to reset the time. Computer/transmitter Battery Warning All devices from BC 14.16 upward come with a battery status indicator. The power status of the battery in the computer head unit or STS transmitter is checked at regular intervals. If the battery is low, an early warning is displayed on the computer head unit. Bike Service Reminder Thanks to the service interval, your bike mechanic can set a service reminder based on the number of kilometers/miles that your ride, making sure that your bike is tuned and ready for each ride. The service interval is set using the UNIVERSAL FAST SETTING BOX. When service is due, a bike service icon will appear on your screen at the start of a ride. Simply press any button to dismiss the reminder until a later date.   Digitally Encoded Three-channel Wireless Transmission The tried-and-tested SIGMA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM (STS) is the digitally encoded transmission system for all transmitter data from the speed transmitter, the cadence transmitter, and even the heart rate transmitters for the high-quality basic devices and top models. The transmitters collate the data they have received and send this to the receiver integrated into the computer as a data package. The transmitters also regularly send stored test data for data comparison purposes. The digital encoding of the SIGMA TRANSMISSION SYSTEM prevents transmitter data from being corrupted by external interference such as power sources or other transmitters. The interference of Sigma products, e.g. LED lights, can also be prevented. Bike Functions Ride Time / Training time, Comparison of cur. / avg.

But the truth is, it is far too soft and provides almost zero support.I agonize over my purchases, reading as many reviews as I can stand.

As stated above, I really don't care to leave negative reviews. I am very pleased to say that I am amending my original review to the full five stars. I honestly wish I could give more than that, but I can't, so I will simply tell you why this is an excellent purchase.I posted this review on 5 March. Today, 10 March, I received a package in the post. I was perplexed, as I was not expecting a package. FORTEM SENT ME A NEW LUMBAR SUPPORT PILLOW.This one is firm but not hard, which is exactly what I need. It is PERFECT. I have days where I am seated at my computer or my work table constantly. I need something that will provide adequate lumbar support or I ache for it for the next two days. The original pillow I received was of memory foam, which I love for other things, but was not adequate for my needs. I was resigned to having to make one for myself. Then I received this in the mail today and I am beyond pleased. It's PERFECT. It is supportive and firm, with just enough give to mold ever so to my person. It is the difference between night and day for me. Without the proper support, discomfort begins within the hour and progresses from there. I keep Doan's on my desk, if that tells you anything. I have been sitting here for a while now, doing my thing, and I have no discomfort or pain. This is such a huge thing for me, it truly is. I have been through a number of chairs trying to find a proper work chair with proper support and that gets right expensive. The chair I use now works, but the back was awful. WAS awful.Great job, FORTEM. I will laud you copiously whenever appropriate, and perhaps even randomly despite what strange looks I might receive.Wow! That a difference this makes on my computer chair. After sitting for long periods, I can actually get up and walk and no be in pain on my lower back.This would probably work really well as a support for an office chair, but not for your car if your car seats are bucket shaped. The position of the straps meant it was positioned several inches away from the the seat, plus the straps were also not long enough to go around my car seat. I have a Volkswagen GTI, so not a very big car.Was ready to return because it was defective. Read in reviews how it expanded. Opened up packaging and within minutes was perfect. Would definitely buy agaion.I am very disappointed with this item, it is not fit for purpose, after being out of plastic bag for more than six hours it is as flat as a pancake. Absolutely no use at all for what it was sold for and also is different to the picture advertised on Amazon. Would definitely not recommend it to anyone.I needed this for my car unfortunately the elastic is too short and wouldn't fit around the seat, even though it's shown on a car seat. I don't have a big car so doubt it would fit any others. I was going to send it back but hope to find another use for it.Got one for one of the guys in the office. He was so impressed with it that I've had to get one for another member of staff. I have a suspicion I'm going to end up looking for a volume discount.The cushion is really comfortable on my back and was easy enough to clip around my chair. It does seem to support my back more and my amount of back pains have reduced. It has provided more support for my chair to keep my posture better more often, although I still find I slouch (could be just my error). Otherwise I am very happy with this product.This is a brilliant product especially for anyone newly working from home. I have had so much pain in my back and this product really reduces the discomfort. I wish I had bought it earlier!

Easton Encore Hybrid,Easton,"The 2023 Easton Encore Hybrid -10 USSSA Baseball Bat pulls in all the best features of Easton's cutting edge bat engineering, resulting in a 2-piece hybrid bat that will earn you a reputation as an offensive force every time you step in the box. We built the barrel of this bat with CompCore Technology, pulling together cutting-edge elements of alloy and composite barrel design. To create the CompCore barrel, the ringless R5 alloy of the Encore Hybrid is thinned out by about 30% and then reinforced with Thermo Composite Technology across the length of the hitting surface. This creates an ultra-thin barrel wall, bigger sweet spot, and maximum ""trampoline effect"" upon contact. The PureLynk CXN joint connects the handle directly to the barrel, maximizing the energy transfer and stiff feel of the Pro-Stiff carbon handle. All of these features add up to a bat that captures as much energy as you can generate and efficiently transfers it to the baseball — but all you have to do is swing it hard and watch it fly. You'll not only see the difference that the Easton Encore Hybrid makes, but you'll hear it, too. The unique, cutting edge barrel design creates a one-of-a-kind sound off the bat that's sure to echo in a pitcher's ears as you're rounding the bases. We topped this bat off with Flow-Tack grip, our most premium bat grip, to give you the ultimate combination of cushion and tack swing after swing.

Der DGS-1210-28 hat 24 ""echte"" RJ45 Ports, die 4 Mini GBIC sind also 4 weitere Ports und nicht wie beim Vorgänger geshared. Nicht wirklich ein Kaufargument, der um 12€ günstigere Preis des DGS-1210-28 ist es schon eher. Die Entscheidung stand also fest.Lieferung wie immer schnell und problemlos. An der Verpackung von D-Link könnte man anmerken, dass andere Hersteller inzwischen vollständig auf Schaumstoffeinsätze verzichten (speziell, wenn man mit ""Green-IT"" wirbt). Aber nun gut...Geliefert wurde die aktuelle Hardware-Version ""B1"" mit der letzten Firmware. Im Lieferumfang enthalten sind 2 Netzkabel (Schuko und UK), 19"" Winkel, Gummifüße zum Kleben, Ressource-CD plus Schnellstartanleitung. Die GBIC-Ports sind mit Staubschutzkappen versehen. Der Switch hat keinen separaten Erdungsanschluß - hoffen wir mal, dass das Gehäuse sauber über das Netzkabel geerdet ist.Nach dem Einbau in das Rack habe ich erst mal nur die wichtigsten Verbindungen für einen Test gesteckt - die FritzBox 3370 und einen Windows 7 PC.Der Switch hat als Default IP die 10.90.90.90. Über das D-Link SmartConsole Tool (auf CD oder per Download) läßt sich diese ändern, auch wenn der Client in einem anderen Adressbereich läuft.Hier kam das erste Problem: Per DHCP wollte der Switch keine IP-Adresse von der FritzBox holen. Also erst mal eine Adresse manuell vergeben.Zugriff auf die Weboberfläche: Sehr schnell (im Vergleich zum Netgear rasend) und gut strukturiert. Sehr zweckmäßig...an der ein oder anderen Stelle hätte etwas mehr Modernität geholfen (Porteinstellungen, Portstatistiken etc. alles in nüchterner Tabellenform)Die Oberfläche liegt in mehreren Sprachen vor, die beim Login gewählt werden kann. Die deutsche Übersetzung ist ok, wenn auch nicht vollständig. An wenigen Stellen tauchen spanische oder italienische Übersetzungen auf. Wer Englisch beherrscht sollte die englische Version verwenden.Völlig an der Realität vorbei haben die Entwickler bei den Einstellungen der Zeitsynchronisierung SNTP gearbeitet. Aktiviert man die Daylightsaving (Zeitumstellung) Funktion, muss man dann doch tatsächlich ein festes Kalenderdatum (Monat und Tag) des Umstellungstages einstellen. IMHO nutzt kein Land der Erde einen festen Kalendertag für die Zeitumstellung, sondern doch eher sowas wie ""letzter Sonntag im Oktober"" o.ä. Letztendlich unbrauchbar und von mir auch ungenutzt. Der Switch holt sich die Zeit von der FritzBox, wenn man diese als NTP-Server einträgt.Wenn, ja wenn, er den mal sauber mit der FritzBox kommunizieren würde. Tat er leider nicht. Auch der angeschlossene Windows 7 PC hat vom Fritzbox DHCP-Server keine IP-Adresse mehr bekommen. Mit einem DHCP-Testool auf dem Windows 7 PC konnte ich lediglich feststellen, dass der DHCP Discover Broadcast im Netzwerks unbeantwortet verhallte. Nach stundenlanger Suche, rumprobieren und verzweifeln habe ich sogar einen Case beim D-Link Support aufgemacht. Dieser ist angesichts des Wochenendes natürlich noch nicht beantwortet.Jetzt hatte ich so viele Einstellungen im Switch und FritzBox probiert, dass ein Werksreset des Switches sinnvoll war. Danach habe ich ausser der festen IP erstmal gar nix mehr verstellt - lief trotzdem nicht. Internetverbindung war vorhanden, aber DHCP wollte nicht. Auch die in der Zwischenzeit angeschlossenen TP-Link Access-Points konnten den angemeldeten WLAN Geräten keine IP-Adresse vom DHCP holen.Im Internet fand ich dann weitere Leidensgenossen, die Probleme mit diversen Switches an einer FritzBox hatten. Viele berichteten, dass eine Einstellung der Ports in der FritzBox von ""Power-Modus"" (=Gigabit) auf ""Green"" (=Fast Ethernet) Besserung brachte. Bei mir leider nicht.Aber : der D-Link hat auch PowerSaving-Einstellungen, die standardmäßig aktiviert sind (Cable Length Detection und Link Status Detection)Nach Deaktivierung dieser Funktionen ging plötzlich alles. Der DHCP-Server der FritzBox war erreichbar! Muss ich nicht verstehen...Die restlichen Einstellungen waren dann schnell gemacht und funktionierten sofort. Nutzen tue ich noch LACP für mein Netgear ReadyNAS und VLAN-Tagging für die WLAN Access-Points. Den Rest der vielen Layer2-Features und Reporting-Features wie RMON, SNMP nutze ich nicht.Fazit:Für knapp 130 € bekommt man einen wirklich gut ausgestatteten und sparsamen 24/28 Port Gigabit-Smart-Switch. Die Oberfläche könnte man sicher noch optimieren, erfüllt aber schnell und einfach ihren Zweck.Würde ich wieder kaufen und auch weiterempfehlen.","[""Manageable - Yes"",""Compatible_Rack_Unit - 1U"",""Ethernet_Technology - Fast Ethernet"",""Number_Of_Total_Expansion_Slots - 4""]"

This is for you. - It keeps your watch off the counter when charging, and you just need to put your watch on it. With a sturdy base and anti-slip silicone pad, it will hold the watch securely in place without fear of toppling over or falling. - It leaves enough space for your phone, thus you don’t need to take off the protection case of the phone when charging. - The cable hole is a bit tight to make the cable fit better and to prevent the cord from getting pulled out when you take your Airpods from the dock. - Please note that it is made of hybrid hard PC with a metal appearance, and a base with silicone pad for better stability. - Highly recommend if you are looking for a stand to use your own cord. Things You Should Know Q: Is the stand made of metal or plastic? A: It is made of premium hybrid hard PC material with a metal appearance. And it has reasonable weight to hold it in place so you don’t have to worry about it sliding around or falling over. Q: Does it come with Apple Watch charger? A: No, it is a cradle only, charger and cables are not included; you will need to use your original Apple Watch charger and Airpods charging cable.

I know I gained weight/lost muscle this winter pandemic, but still surprising. Size 6 is usually pretty loose on me, but more comfortable than a size 4. Not saying the fit is a problem, but I think they run a little smaller than what many may expect. I have the prana Halle straight leg pants and they are looser, but the overall cut at the top is very similar. I wish the pockets didn’t pop out so much (see pictures), and wish that they were a little higher on the waist. They are very comfortable and I will probably end up living in them this spring despite the drawbacks. I am predicting that leggings will go out of style soon, and also starting to feel too old for them in my 30s, so don’t want to keep buying more, this was my compromise. I don’t really see how we can do yoga without leggings though? Maybe the pockets will distract from the tummy fat I’ve gained in the last year?These are 3/4, which is annoying for a person with long legs, but probably ideal for an average to short assigned-female-at-birth human. I’m a little over 5’6” and about 135lbs for reference. Color is on point. Hoping durability is on point too because I don’t like fast fashion. Hope this helps in your shopping decision!",null

This one works great!First of all, if $250 is cheap to you, we are not the same. This company sells several similar models and I ordered the higher end model thinking it would be top of the line. This was a Christmas present to myself, to replace my old Roomba, which is just getting worn out and constantly needs replacement parts. I thought this ilife, being newer, would be smarter and I'd be able to sort of turn it on and wake up to clean floors and a fully charged robot. I was also super excited about the mopping feature. What this machine really turns out to be is an overpriced novelty. My ancient, clunky roomba still picks up more dirt and pet hair than this thing, despite being on its last legs. This robot does not pick up very much pet hair at all and just pushes birdseed into corners without picking it up. This thing can get under the couch and tables but can't find its way out again, it's constantly stuck somewhere. As for the mopping, you might as well tie a wet dishrag to your dog's tail and let them drag it around. It barely swipes at the floor, the water runs out in like 20 minutes, also it will get stuck (as usual) and spin in one spot, slowly releasing a puddle of water around itself, and paddling around in it. Despite the poor mopping I probably would have kept it anyway if it were any good at vacuuming but it's not. The only good things about this robot are battery life and that it does a good job returning to its dock to charge. I was really disappointed with this and will not purchase another ilife product. If you buy this, save the box cause you'll probably want to send it back too. FYI, I have a very small house (about 850sqft), with all tile and laminate floors, 4 small dogs, and a large cage of budgies.Hace buen trabajo recoge mucha basura y es fácil de usas solo tiene que reconocer el espacio de la casaIt does what it is supposed to and clean. Works best on hardwood floors than carpet, but isn’t bad. Two things I don’t like: it doesn’t map out the house and is super random in its pattern; randomly, the days and times set will reset on their own in the app. It’s not bad, but it’s not the greatest. Spend a little extra to get a good oneDoes an amazing job of picking up dirt and dog hair.Will not return to charger and does about half of 1100sq.ft home never has done entire home would not recommend it at allSo I bought an older version years ago and it finally crapped out and wouldn't hold charge anymore - BUT it worked wonderfully for 6+ years!Fast forward to May, 2021 when I bought the max 80 and it wasnt the same, but I kept it to give it a solid chance. Worked fine, had some struggle finding the dock on occasion, but nothing consistent. July 2021 our power went out for a few hours and now the robot won't connect at all to wifi. It's not made it back to the charging dock ONCE since power outage. It stops randomly in the middle of the room and shuts off. I had high hopes for this ""upgraded"" version to the original, but it falls short.I do like the mop feature, but obviously haven't used it since it's been on the fritz.So the two features I purchased this for (automatic return and wifi status) are now useless.I absolutely love it. We have two women at home, there are tons of hairs on the floor.... It picks up hairs super great! When it is done, it goes back to charge itself... This is very convenient too, because I thought I had to pick it up and bring it back to the charger.I also let it mops the kitchen floor every day. It can pick up food particles and mop the floor at the same time...

And these don't leak, don't stop writing, and don't break. Also, they erase nicely, even from a rather cheap white board surface.I'll be buying them again, if they ever run dry.Some of the markers lasted a day or 2 before drying out.They do the job my 4year old enjoys themThese are by far my favorite dry erase marker.

She asked me to explain exactly what had gone wrong and if possible send a picture. She was very patient and professional while speaking with both my husband and me. She texted and emailed us during each step of the process to correct the issue. Today our rug arrived and to our delight, it is perfect. Thank you so much.I rated this rug a 3 Star.It was just as it described, as far as the pile height and thickness.I love that it is American-Made. I always try to either support local or American-Made when I can.The reason that I returned the rug was that the binding was not the same gray as the gray rug.The product description described the area rug as solid in color.The product pictures also look like the gray binding and the gray rug are the same color.In my humble opinion, the two colors clash and make the rug look two-toned.Unfortunately, it's not what I was looking for in an area rug.It's a shame. I ordered the little size rug to make sure the color was right.I'm glad I did before ordering several in bigger sizes.I hope the company fixes this detail, and I wish them the best. :)I would totally return this item if it wasn’t such a large piece. Unfortunately the color is much lighter than pictured, and it came with mancreases in it, I have to put boards all over it to try to iron out the creases and it’s very difficult. This is a regretful purchase.I now have 11 of these! I had the privilege of speaking with their office manager last week, and she confirmed for me that this 3rd-party seller is dedicated to the quality of its carpets that are MADE IN NORTH CAROLINA, USA. They're beautiful and durable, and I like the fact that they don't slip as easily as others while, at the same time, they're easy to move when I vacuum and mop. They're also a cinch to vacuum. All of the colors that I've chosen so far are vivid -- the cranberry, the navy blue, and the neon blue are amazing. I've only cleaned up a minor spot on one in the kitchen, and it was easily removed. Thank Goodness for quality carpets that will last a long time and are easy to maintain -- KP HarwellThis area rug is top notch quality and exactly what I was looking for. Bought 2 in ivory color. Low soft pile easy to clean and vacuum! Returned another brand that I bought before this one and I have to say that made in the USA makes a difference in the quality! Reminded me of so many great USA made items we grew up with. It’s worth the extra dollars and would gladly pay extra to buy more goods made here!! Thanks!!The color was just like the photo and it seems very durableThe instructions were not clear on how (NOT) to clean - i.e., DO NOT MACHINE WASH. the rug came apart - literally - in the washer. My bad - should have read the instructions more closely. There was a clear implication to clean it by hand, but nothing specific. I'll know better next time. I liked the rug - it just was not as easy to clean as I assumed. In fact, I bought another one, this time knowing NOT to machine wash. Caveat emptor - and caveat lectorum.The rug has a lot of orange or red, but it totally clashed with my dark brown decor. It also felt super cheap an the backing was crumbling off, I unrolled the rug.... and returned the next day.

It installs easily. It's easy to use the folds to have it in landscape view. I was looking for a case will full coverage for extra protection. This had some open spots like most cases. I would recommend it. It looks exactly as online, just not what I was looking for this time.very sturdy and fits perfectlyI looked and compared for a really long time for a case for my new kindle and finally settled on this one. It is durable, sturdy, and I really like the color. There are a lot of options for positioning the table for viewing and typing which is nice. It does not cover the speakers at all, so when you prop it up to watch something the sound is fine. Here is my one issue. When you want to watch something on the tablet and you want the speakers to be at the top so the sound is better, you have to fold the tablet into a position where the inside of the cover is face out on whatever surface you have the tablet on. So, if I want to put my tablet on a surface that is a little dirty or sticky, the inside velvet surface will be sitting on it. If you don't mind watching something with the speakers face down, where the sound will be slightly blocked, you will fold the tablet with the outside side protected surface of the tablet on the surface you have it resting on. Of course, this is not a problem at all if you are using earbuds because you won't be needing to use the speakers, which is what I do most of the time anyways. So while it is an issue for me, it is only a small issue. But I don't think this is the fault of the tablet case, it is due to the speakers being put on the wrong side of the tablet.Looks like leather it looks really nice definitely recommendI was a little hesitant of getting this cover b/c I was afraid the Fire would flop around since the cover only connects to half the back but it surprisingly works really well. And it seems like the cover is magnetized to the back when opened which helps hold it in place. Cover seems solid and rugged, was surprised how heavy it felt out of the bag. Holding it to type this now I can feel the weight so best not to use this with your arm in the air. Feels fine resting my hand on my leg.Got the gilding design, looks and feels good.There is a cutout for the back camera when you open the lid all the way, sort of 3/4 around. Folding it in a triangle, the way you would use it for the front camera on top to Zoom, makes a big handle for taking back camera pics. Not that I'd ever take a pic w/ a Fire tablet.Being able to have the camera on top for Zoom is the reason I bought this cover, having the cover also open ""halfway"" w/ the buttons on top where they belong is also good.Has anybody asked Amazon why they put the front camera on the wrong side? Well until they move it back where it belongs, probably in 2 years for the next model, this is a good cover to get.When I bought my new Fire HD10+, I ordered the keyboard case with it, not realizing it would be heavy and not really convenient for streaming. I had this Timovo style case with my very first Fire, so looked for that again. This is a great case. The magnets are so strong and secure that there is no concern about slipping when in the horizontal position for streaming and the cover holds tight to keep the tablet asleep securely.The graphic that I picked - looks like the Milky Way Galaxy - is very cool. The cover is quality vinyl and the felt liner is soft and appears sturdy. Highly recommend. Now I have this light weight cover for when I don't need the keyboard attachment.I bought this case as well as another brand that had good reviews. This one was so much nicer. It didn’t feel like cheap plastic and was much better quality. It was even stands well on a bed and the sleep function works as described. I’ve had the Amazon brand case previously for the Fire HD 8, and this case is much nicer overall.The main draw back is the fact that this cover will not allow magnetic charging. I knew this before I purchased and was drawn to the design and sturdiness. But, if you are interested in desktop magnetic charging look around for another product.(The Amazon 2021 10) tablet is new so they case price cost around £20. The case looks smart, professional and feels decent. The camera hole is on the hard part of the case which hold the tablet, the outer material case doesn't have one. It study and isn't easily pushed over depending on the flap set-up. I hope to take the tablet to work and will update about longevity of the case. I've attached pictures hopefully it helpsThere is no hole in the case for the rear camera. How can they advertise this as suitable for the item in question.Bought for my mum for her new HD Fire, had it sent direct to her address. She says it's a nice coloured case, however, was perplexed that it did not have a hole in the back for the camera? Possibly a faulty one? Sadly I can't send it back as in the meantime, my dad has now drilled a hole in the back of it so the camera can be used, of a sorts if you ignore the frayed edged frame to the photos! Can't wait to see it!I thought at first this was quite expensive compared to others I've bought but I am genuinely not disappointed with the case.It is a great fit and good quality case.Arrived in good time too More than happy and would definitely recommendIt fits the tablet well, provides good protection and is just what I needed.","[""💙 COMPATIBILITY - Custom designed for All New Fire HD 10 Tablet and Fire HD 10 Plus Tablet (10.1\"" 11th Generation, 2021 Release).

As expected the toe area was painfully narrow, I was able to buy a shoe stretcher and that definitely helped and I’m sure after a few more wears they will stretch more. I don’t have wide feet there’s just something about this brand that’s always tight.

Featuring a variable rate coil spring, these strut assemblies include all high-quality components needed in a single, fully assembled unit. Fit checked, ride tested and engineered with either Acceleration Sensitive Damping or Monotube technology for improved vehicle control over abrupt bumps, dips and potholes, they are designed for hardworking half-ton trucks like: Ford F-150 Chevy Silverado GMC Sierra RAM 1500 Toyota Tundra Improve your vehicle’s ride performance when you install a Magnum loaded strut assembly. Including all the components required for strut replacement without the need for a spring compressor, this strut assembly features a strut, variable rate coil spring and strut mount preassembled for easy installation. Strut assemblies perform two main jobs: perform a damping function like shock absorbers and provide structural support for the vehicle suspension by supporting the spring and holding the tire in an alignment. CAUSES &amp; CONSEQUENCES OF STRUT FAILURE Like many parts on your vehicle, struts are subject to wear. Causes include damaged bushings, exposure to the elements, worn oil and gradual degradation of internal components over time. Driving with worn struts can result in problems ranging from reduced braking efficiency, cause premature tire wear, loss of stability and damage to other suspension parts. IMPORTANCE OF AN ALIGNMENT Always perform an alignment anytime replacement shocks, struts or other ride control parts are installed. Camber, toe and caster settings can all be affected by installing new struts. Failure to make sure the vehicle’s alignment is within factory specifications can lead to problems like premature tire wear. IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING RIDE HEIGHT Proper ride height is crucial to vehicle durability, performance and safety. When inspecting a vehicle, don’t just check the static ride height. The dynamic ride height – the ride height of a vehicle in motion – may tell a different story. The cause of dynamic ride height issues is often worn or damaged coil springs. Don’t just replace the strut – be sure to also inspect for and replace worn coil springs. HOW TO PROPERLY INSTALL A STRUT ASSEMBLY Avoid noise after installing a strut assembly with this four-step procedure. Loosely install 1 or 2 upper mounting nuts and position lower strut mount to steering knuckle assembly Install lower mounting bolts and lower vehicle to the ground Locate manufacturer torque specifications Torque lower bolts and secure upper mounting nuts in alternating pattern","[""Automotive"",""Replacement Parts"",""Shocks, Struts & Suspension"",""Struts""]",‎Monroe Shocks & Struts,,"I have a 2012 ram 1500 4x4 sport with trx package and these fit right on with no problems.

It fits perfectly and lives permanently attached to the square drive on the acetylene tank...all i have to do is flip the lever to open or close the valve. That lever is smoooooth and easy to actuate and the ratchet mechanism is also quite nice feeling for the price. I have not torqued on it like a caveman or tried to force this tool into service for which is was not intended so I cannot speak for longevity, or it't heavy ""duty-ness"" ...but I have also used a tool or two in my day and this feels quite adequate for most of the HVAC and square drive fasteners I am familiar with. It should last you a good long time if you dont throw it in a bag of sand and then try to use it as a chin up bar after eating a dozen krispy kreme doughnuts! Totally worth every penny not having to screw around in a tiny, limited space plastic tote that the cylinders are stored/carried in. Works perfect for my needs....and again, yes it was worth the $11-$12 just to do that one task. No more fighting to fit in other tooling or possibly rounding off my bottle's valve. ....and an added benefit is I am no longer homicidal because of the struggle just to turn on my gas by time I get some angry fire lit and attached to my hand. ;)I bought this with my own hard earned money.

The leather does not breath as well as the SAS shoes so my feet sweat more, and occasionally my feet get cold because of the extra dampness.These shoes cost 1/3 to 1/2 less than the SAS made in USA shoes, so for the price they are fine enough and was what I could afford at the time.I find them not as comfortable as SAS shoes, but passable.As the sole on these will probably last longer, it will give me enough time to save and I will go back to the SAS Time Out for my next pair.",null

Single speaker ≠ stereo.The sound was clear but the bass felt muddy, as it should when you have only a single speaker trying to do everything.""Angel, what makes you say there's only one speaker? Did you take it apart?""No, what I did do was start some music and put my ear to every part of the device and found that the only place there was sound was from the very obvious single speaker pointing out of the side.""But maybe they stacked the speakers behind each other?""If that were the case, it would be another reason to be disappointed. But if they did I'm sure I would have heard the sound coming from the other side of the tube, which I did not. Or maybe one of the speakers was DOA, but when you look through the grille on the other side, there is no speaker like the primary facing the other way.I also didn't like that the volume buttons were the same as the skip track buttons, in order to turn it up (and you would want to turn it up because it's not really that loud), you have to hold down the skip button. Not exactly ideal or an efficient use of the vast amount of unused space on the speaker.Did I mention that it's a big waste of space? Single speaker at one end, small buttons and inputs at the other end, then a vast swath of nothing in between. For what you get it's very over-sized; possibly to make you feel like you're getting your money's worth.""Angel, you said it's not really that loud, what do you mean?""It's loud enough if you just want to jam out by yourself in a small to medium sized room, but if you were to take it outside to the beach or a park with friends, I feel like they'd be a bit disappointed if you were the only person with a speaker.""Well... is there anything good you can say about it?""It's not awful...It feels very sturdy, very UNfragile, like you could knock it around a bit.Excellent item would order againGreat value for the price. Got it for the drive-in. Had a really hard time finding the station as there are no numeric indicators anywhere on it to know what station you're on. But once we finally got it connected to the right station (took about 10 minutes to find it), it worked really well.Pretty good unit, sounds good, price is good. Like the controls but there is no volume control on it, and no wall charger just a cable. I like it would recommend itSound is great but sometimes has a hard time picking up the radioThe sound quality is surprise my good. Originally my husband purchased just to listen to his music from memory sticks. It has done such a good job he's given it to a couple family members to enjoy as well. The dollar value is the surprise of the purchase. The battery life is pleasantly longer than either of is expected.This product gives the bang for your buck😉Bought it for a home gym.Pro:Looks great.Has plenty of volume.Initial battery charge lasted 4+ hours, but it is new...Inexpensive.Con:Sounds like a cheap radio, I get better sound using my IPhone speakers.If you are only interested in volume and a variety of inputs, the it's ok.I liked the USB port, tried Bluetooth and radio, still disappointed in sound quality.If you want better quality sound, get something else.I like it...it's cheaper and better sounding than a more expensive one I purchased a couple of weeks ago!

She was really excited about this one as she loves Hello Kitty but, unfortunately, it was a bit of a disappointment. The only color in it is pink. All of the other ones we've gotten have been been very colorful. But not this one; only pink. Even she got bored with it and took over her brother's Thomas the Train coloring book (full of colors, by the way).So yeah, Imagine Inks are great usually but not this one.these are cheaper quality than I thought for being a ""water book"" and they should cost less than $6-$10 each.

"The Step Original Aerobic Platform, Health Club Size Steppers for Exercise with 4 Risers for Adjustable Home Workout, Stair Stepper for Exercise and Home Gym",Freestyle STEP,"Achieve total-body fitness with The Step Club Size Aerobic Platform, the same step used in fitness clubs across the country. The Step is a great home-fitness tool for beginners to experts and is customizable for a variety of aerobic and strength exercises. This set includes a grey nonslip platform, 2 patented freestyle risers and 2 original risers to create the foundation of any workout program. The Club Size platform features one (1) stepping surface (43"" L x 16"" W x 4"" H) and four (4) risers (16"" L x 16"" W x 2"" H). These sturdy risers can be used on any type of indoor flooring from carpet to concrete to hardwood without leaving behind scratches. The patented freestyle risers add variety to your workout with multiple slanted positions perfect for adding intensity to push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, and more. Burn more calories the higher you step with 4"" to 6"" to 8"" platform height options using the risers. Each riser and platform is made with four nonskid feet to prevent sliding or moving during exercise. Both the platform and rises also feature a resistance band notch, which safely holds an optional resistance band in place.","[""Sports & Outdoors"",""Exercise & Fitness"",""Accessories"",""Step Platforms""]",The Step Company,Sports & Outdoors,"I purchased the Freestyle Step via Amazon Prime and received it in 2 days as usual.  The box and item were in perfect condition as expected.I sit in a cubicle most of the day, and needless to say my legs do not get worked out.  Even with running and other activities my legs are still a little weak, my first idea was to find a school with a stadium close by to run stairs, but it's hard to find any that aren't locked up anymore.  I thought about a stair machine of some sort, but finally decided on giving the step a chance to start giving my legs a challenge.The Freestyle step I got has 2 risers on each side which gives me 8 inches to step up to.  I thought this was not going to be challenging and that I'd have to buy additional risers, but nstead I figured I'd try it out and give 8 inches a chance.Since it came with 2 DVDs I wanted to see what they were like, so I tried the first, Beginning Step, in which you basically use it in multiple aerobic movements such as: stepping up, straddling, leg and knee raises, hamstring curls, around the world, a few basic dance moves, and more.  Since I am constantly moving I think more risers would have been too much for beginning, so I am going to wait a little bit to order additional ones.  The Beginning Step DVD is about 35 minutes of workouts: warm-up, more advanced, a core workout on the floor, and a quick cool-down stretch.  This does get the blood pumping, and although they do get a little quick, it's not hard to keep up with once you get the moves, and if you want you could go at your own pace by not doing as many of each.I have not used the second DVD yet which incorporates the Freestyle moves which puts The Step into unique positions (tilted, not level), but I'll try these in a couple more weeks and try to remember to come back and add to this review.The Step also works great as an additional tool to strength training such as calve raises, lunges, and core.  You can use it for many other strength exercises as well as adding in cardio to the strength training activity.Overall, I really like the added aerobic/strength workout I get, and after I see how the second DVD is, I might look for additional videos too.  I definitely would recommend this Step to anyone who wants a fun aerobic activity.EDIT: April 23, 2012 - I have now been actively using disc 2 of the DVDs that came with the Freestyle Step.  They use some of the same variations I listed above with some additions and variations.  The second DVD is about 51 minutes as opposed to 35 minutes for the first DVD.There is more of what they call power moves where you jump or hop step.  You also get to invert the step in the standard position with the angle facing down toward you with one freestyle riser on each side.

I had a very pleasant and informative conversation with Iso Acoustics on the phone and they explained the tuning and engineering that goes into these. I put my speakers on a very accurate scale and found that the weights on their website were incorrect, and I sent them the proper data. Actually, Buchardts weights on their own website were wrong too! I think they were using shipping weight including the box, and not the bare speakers themselves. I digress, these units were shockingly good! First of all, the soundstage expanded left and right by at least 2 feet on each side. While my room limits where I can place my speakers, and impacts the sense of depth, these have me at least a foot increase in the sense of depth. I witnessed improvements across the board, from the texture and resolution of the bass to the smoothness of the high frequencies. Perhaps the biggest improvement was in the midrange when it comes to male and female vocals. Fidelity increased to the point where it now feels like you have a singer right there in your room. You can also hear the room where the music was recorded much more clearly, and even feel the echoes of the instruments reflecting off the walls. Every new track feels like you are moving to a completely different venue and recording space and it was astounding.I can't give it a full 5 starts because these things are expensive! I ended up using 8 of them and it is a tough pill to swallow even now thinking back on it. It is out of control. To Isoacoustic's defense, they do have a less expensive line called Isopucks which have a wider weight band and are not as precisely tailored in terms of performance. If these were just a bit less expensive I would give them 5 starts, but in terms of performance there is a very noticeable difference. I would say it will improve your experience by at least 30%. Before you run off and get a brand new DAC or upgrade your interconnects, I would highly recommend looking into these first. If you want to bring things into focus a bit more, make the highs a bit sweeter then a new powercord or interconnect will certainly make a difference, but the 'issue' can also be solved using this. Since you'll eventually end up with using something like this anyways, I would start with these and then fine tune using speaker placement, power cords and cables afterwards. That way, the sound with the IsoAcoustics will remain a constant and not a variable that you throw into the mix at a later date after you've already perfected your system using other methods.If I could start all over, I would have started with first purchasing strategically placed sound absorbing panels, followed by a good rug and finally extremely precise speaker placement. I would then have moved onto IsoAcoustics and spend a good amount of time with understanding the sound. Then and only then would I have started tweaking cables!If you have the money to invest in your system and this is a hobby that brings you joy and listening pleasure, there are certainly worse luxury items to spend your money on. I highly recommend these for HiFi enthusiasts, and you don't even need a discerning ear to hear the improvements.I have some IsoAcoustic platforms for my main speakers so I was curious if these little guys would make a difference for my small bookshelf speakers. They are absolutely amazing. They give a sonic lift to acoustic classical and jazz recordings (esp vinyl) and increase the flexibility and texture of bass and strings. And all for @ $150! Five stars for sure.Removes a level of noise that I wasn't even aware of, leading to quieter backgrounds and increased soundstage depth.I have three of those under each one of my Audience 1+1 v3, replacing some less expensive vibrapod rubber footers. The difference was immediately heard in terms of focus and soundstage. While the vibrapods served me well for a while, these are definitely an upgrade. They made the mid bass more solid. I don’t think I will ever need to replace them.I have these on several audio devices. They are easy to fit to the device, lift the device from the shelf surface a perfect height, and provide excellent stability and isolation.They do as advertised.

I put them on this morning to go walk thinking I could break them in or soften that spot a bit, but it was too painful to walk. The right shoe isn't bothering my foot at all, but it does have that same reinforced area and stitching.I bought the 8.5, my usual size, although sometimes I go up to a 9 depending on the shoe. I was worried about buying a shoe online, but with the pandemic, going to a shoe store and trying on many shoes was not an option. After reading many reviews that mostly said they fit true to size, I went with an 8.5. My foot tends toward wide, but I never buy wide shoes. If the shoe is too narrow in the toebox, though, I can't wear it.  These fit just right, plenty of room for my toes if I don't wear a really thick sock (which I do not.)

During the 1970s a modern day over the counter products was rarely seen and heard elsewhere. Navnit Mehra draws from the cultural background of a prominent family typically having a rich traditional lineage of 'Hakims'. She could not pull off her lifelong dream of starting a 100% natural, Ayurveda & Apothecary brand of organic products until in 2016, Arjoon - her son undoubtedly inspired her. Greenberry Organics is a fresh and modern-day apothecary preparation based on the unique experience of a traditional 'Unani, Hakim & Vaid' family that dates back to almost 7 marked decades. What makes your product special? At Greenberry Organics, our organic products are traditionally made from Ayurveda recipes which have been improved remarkably over the considerable period of time to co-exist with the modern-day demands on increasing skin issues. We use 100% USDA & ECOCERT certified ingredients. Being one of the leading and brightest start-ups we focus on certain fine grade Bio Active ingredients from Brazil, Spain & Germany like - Sun Cat DE, Phyto Defense CLR, MuruMuru Butter, Pracaxi Oil Complex, Pentavitin, Nipa Guard SCE, etc. We are over here to make the potential customers sufficiently realise the distinct advantages of these 100% naturally derived essential ingredients.

Went together easy enough, although is does get dicey near the end if you have big hands. Folds up for storage, or can be posed for display. Love it!Bought this for my adult son for Christmas. He stayed up Christmas eve until 2am putting it together. He said it wss the best Christmas present he has received since he was a kid.This was a wonderful gift for my boys. They love legos and this thing takes mechanical legoing to a slightly more complex level. This thing is great for developing engineering basic concepts. I would recommend this and buy it again should the need arise.This was a gift for my grandson. He loves doing LEGO’S. Sadly, the price has doubled since the Pandemic, no doubt that will change... but this was one of the better priced cranes. I have to add that my grandson immediately started working on this and had it done within a few days... by the way, he just turned 8!Our 11 year old grandson wanted a challenging lego set for Christmas so I foundI would suggest using someone else to change the seals if the person you have used is not getting the job done right. this and hoped he would like it and he got just what he wanted. He said it took him 7 straight hours and he did it all by himself. So proud of him and we are looking forward to his next great challenging set for his next gift.I ordered this set from Amazon (sold by Amazon), the set was sealed, and it was missing an entire bag worth of parts. Called LEGO customer service, and they sent the missing parts.Once I had all the parts, this set was a fun build. The legs are a little wobbly, but the crane function is awesome. My kids love playing with it as well.Our 12 year old loves it. Put it together with a few hours over the course of a couple of nights. Great to play with after you’re done building too!Great kit! Was put together in 3hrs or so. Only fault is the string/cord on the crane. Very loose weave and arrived frayed, making threading it up the arm a task, used tweezers in the end .No es el mejor lego que he armado, se estorban las perillas para accionarlo, pero muy divertido para jugar.Buen producto y bastante entretenidoSi compraría otros modelosItem was delivered promptly and was well-packaged.

"Thule Subterra Carry On Roller 22"", Ember",Thule,"Sleek, spacious, and built to last, the Thule Subterra Carry On is designed to help you pack and travel efficiently. This carry on roller guarantees a smooth pull from the lightweight frame, oversized wheels, and a V-tubing telescoping handle.

The divided main compartment also separates clean-from-dirty and work-from-play, so you are sure to stay organized wherever you go. All Thule rolling luggage is constructed to withstand the rigors of modern travel, and this travel bag is no exception. Durable materials, a solid exoskeleton and a molded back panel combine to absorb impact and leave you with a suitcase always ready for the next adventure. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey.","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Luggage & Travel Gear"",""Luggage"",""Suitcases""]",‏  ‎ Thule,‏  ‎ Unisex-adult,"My wife suggested I get this because I routinely destroy $100 carry-ons.I've used it on about a dozen flights so far, in the hold and carryon, and I like it a lot. It's holding up well - the fabric is tough and the rounded-off shape helps it survive in the hold.Some things to note:- The compression panel really works well, significantly increases what you can pack. This compensates for the fact that the large wheels and rounded shape means the internal volume is a little less than traditional rollerboard-style bags.- The arrangement of internal pockets is different from standard carry-ons, so you may have to re-think your packing approach just a little. In some ways it's better, since it's easy to separate clothes, shoes and toiletries from one another.- The rounded shape means you can't easily sit your laptop bag on top of it. Instead you use a little strap (with a very strong metal hook) to hang your laptop bag behind it (you often see aircrew do this with their bags). One unexpected benefit of this is that the bag balances perfectly when you're pulling it along. I can pull it at a fast walking pace with one finger, and there is much less stress on the extended handle (always the first thing to break on these bags).- The hard plastic wheels are a little noisy on surfaces like concrete, but they seem able to shake off significant punishment - I have dragged them over all kinds of surfaces.This is a quality piece of luggage…sleek, sturdy and rolls great. It it is lightweight which makes it much easier to pull and lift when stowing in overhead carry on. It is very well designed and can hold a surprising amount of clothing due to a very handy removable cover inside that locks down to compress clothing. It has additional spacious compartments for shoes or other bulky items. A family member has had the same Thule luggage for 4 years now, used on many extensive trips and it’s still in excellent shape. Highly recommend!Great functional design and very light.This is my initial reaction - I received the carry on but havent used it yet.Why did I buy this? For the looks, I also picked up a matching Thule laptop bag.It's Expensive!!! It is more durable than my 15 year old $25 American Tourister carry on? Probably not but time will tell. Ive travelled around the world and coutless business trips with the American Tourister carry on and it holds up.Does it have more space? No, it actually has about half the space.Is it better quality? Yes it is better quality but not $300 worth. More like $150-$200.Is it a better design? Lots of effort was put into it but I dont think it is any more functional than the $25 one.So why did I buy it? Lately I have been going on many 3-5 day business trips and I wanted to look good at the airport. Lol - honest truth.I will update this after my next trip.I couldn’t get it apart.The Bad: The only thing I don't really like is the wheels, they are large(which is good) but they are made of a hard plastic and appear to be wearing pretty quickly relative to the rest of the bag.The good: I've taken this thing to Africa once and Europe twice and it still looks great(except the wheels).Design is great. I find the organization to be excellent, you lose some space with the outside pocket on the lid but I think the compression board more than makes up for it. If you pack light like I do, space is not an issue at all.It looks nice. I have the backpack from the subterra collection and have been complimented on both several times.Feels sturdy, the hardshell body and thick padded fabric makes it hold its shape well.The handle with he flat profile makes stacking a backpack(with the appropriate strap or panel) super easy.I love this bag. Read the reviews before purchasing and took notice to those who mentioned they could not put as much in this carryon as others. But I found that not to be a problem. I was a person who didn't know how to pack a small bag. I have travel weekly for a two month period. I think this has been a great choice.Great Luggage you will not be disappointed.This case is miles apart from every £20 to £50 carry on I've ever used. Mega stable wheels, tough as nails handle and zips that just scream ""Do your worst tough-guy""..The inside is a tad smaller than all the cheap nasty cases I've had, but its padded, and the middle is the perfect place to put your laptop / ipad in the board that's clamped down!Its like a ton of thought went into this and somebody just finally made something that isn't a kids toy!Perfect for work travel.

Also very stylishWhen I searched for reviews, people stated that these tweezers worked better than tweezermans so that's why I decided to give these a try. Not that they are terrible, they work great! But definitely not as good as tweezermans. I like the feel of slice tweezers, the wideness makes them easier to handle. I would definitely say give these a try. Great buy!I loved the look and the reviews of this tweezers. I ruined my trusty tweezerman slant by using it as a plyers rather than a tweezers. I ordered and waited...The feel and look are nice. It is comfortable in my hands. However, I cannot seem to grab all hairs like I need to and used to. I would say it is 60% as effective as my tweezerman was. It just sometimes doesn't grip. Strange. If I wasn't lazy, I'd return it. I know someday I will buy another one to replace this.I do not recommend.Holding tweezers by virtue of large handles is great but grip strength for finer or shorter hairs is not good. So it's a comfortable hold but its ability to tweeze is not at all superior to L'oreal branded tweezers with a smaller form factor.Serves the purpose priceyThese are the best tweezers I ever laid my hands on. Got all my facial tweezing in 10 minutes; usualy takes 45. Got a pair of other expensive tweezers for $40 and they did nothing new for me. These are GOLD!~I wanted to buy another of the slice tweezers as i thought the first one which was red colour was great but had lots its sharpness. These are very bult even though new. I cant beleive its from the same company. Very disappointing.I do like these they're nice to handle and don't pinch (Being a slightly older lady with a pinch of extra skin ) Tweezerman are accurate and good but it hurts slightly My ancient ones just don't grab-on as well A worthy beauty must-haveBought hese because I thought at £17 they would be good. Well there not that good. I wouldn't recommend these tweezers as they don't really work that well. It's almost like the tweezers don't meet when you try to pluck a hair !

"Xlear XyloSweet Non-GMO Xylitol Sweetener - Natural Sweetener Sugar Substitute, Granules, 100 Packets (Pack of 1)",Xlear,"About this item 100% PURE XYLITOL: XyloSweet is a 100% pure xylitol sweetener derived from the fibrous parts of plants, similar in taste to regular organic sugar. We use no filler, flow agents or other additives. Granulated xylitol is a natural sugar that tastes just like sugar and a great choice when looking for sweetners and sugar alternatives. DELICIOUS LOW CALORIE KETO SWEETENER: Xylitol may assist in achieving and maintaining a healthy body weight when used with health food. Xylitol sugar is 40% lower in calories than regular sugars, but contains the same sweetness. It can be a great choice for using in foods and snacks, keto friendly foods or used in blood sugar support supplements. CONVENIENT SUGAR REPLACEMENT: XyloSweet can be be used as a substitute for baking sugar and most other common sweeteners and sugar alternatives without compromising taste or texture. XyloSweet is safe with a glycemic index of 7, as opposed to 65 for most table sugars. GREAT TASTE: Unlike other sugar substitutes, xylitol has no after-taste and can be used in most recipes that call for sugar in equal portions without making any additional adjustments. USAGE: When cooking, replace sugar with XyloSweet in equal measurements. Xylosweet is heat stable for cooking and baking. It mixes and dissolves like common sugar. XyloSweet is Non-GMO Project verified for purity and quality you can trust.","[""Grocery & Gourmet Food"",""Pantry Staples"",""Cooking & Baking"",""Baking Syrups, Sugars & Sweeteners"",""Sugar Substitutes"",""Xylitol""]",Xlear,,"I'm not going to delve into the science of sugar alcohols because simply typing ""pharmaceutical grade xylitol"" into Google will tell you all you need to know about the chemistry and uses of Xylitol.This particular product is food grade, but I've also used pharmaceutical grade and as for taste, it's the same.What's important that you understand is:1) Xylitol is, in fact, a sugar alcohol. Like all sugar alcohols there is a slight cooling affect, basically it has a very light minty affect (not to be confused with minty taste) on your tongue. Your tongue will feel like you've had a mildly cool mint lozenge after it passes through your mouth (i.e., sipping a beverage). That's why mints leave your mouth cool long after you've consumed the candy. Does that mean you've had Xylitol before? If you've ever had Trident Gum or used Act mouthwash, then yes. For a list of all brands that contain Xylitol, you can look to the ""Preventive Vet"" website for a fairly comprehensive list.2) Like most sugar alcohols, Xylitol has a laxative affect. If you need an example of what I mean by laxative affect, mosey on over to the famous ""Haribo Sugarfree Gummy Bears"" listing and enjoy reading the reviews. While Haribo uses a completely different sugar alcohol named Maltitol (note the last syllable  ""tol"" in the word MaltiTOL), XtliTOL will basically have the same affect if you over do it. That being said, I would not recommend using more than a tablespoon per serving, with limited servings per day, spread out with hours in between intervals, or you may suffer some unpleasant gastrointestinal consequences. In other words, if you are a Cookie Monster with an insatiable sweet tooth, Xylitol is not the solution to your sugar cravings.**THIS IS WHY IT IS NOT SAFE FOR ANIMALS**It is not ""poison"" like Antifreeze and if your 80lbs Golden Retriever licks your coffee cup he's no sooner going to drop dead than that time he ate a whole Hershey bar. Regardless, don't give it to your animals because they will literally poop themselves sick if they have more than their body weight can handle. It's danger level is similar to Aspartame, pure cocoa, grape seeds (and other seeds/fruit stones), raw onions, etc. I doubt the same people villainizing Xylitol as instant death for dogs refuse to buy chocolate, onions, grapes, avocados, socks and/or plush toys (if you know you know), or household cleaners -- so take those comments with a grain of salt. The best practice is to keep this, any other sugar alcohol, and all foods that are not intended for your animals, in an animal proof container out of their reach. I for one don't let my Dachshunds rummage through the pantry and I have a lock on my trash can to keep the the Australian Shepherd out of it. (I also recommend that you take the same safety precautions if you have young children.)3) It is not calorie free. It has half the calories of processed white sugar, but it has calories nonetheless. But it's perfectly fine in small amounts and will help reduce your calorie intake if used as intended.4) It can have a small, but limited impact on blood sugar. It's not zero like Erythritol, Sucralose, Aspartame, Saccharin, or even Monk Fruit. It has a Glycemic Index of 7, where as Sugar ranks around 60-70.5) If you're willing to pay for it, Isomalt (used in cake decorating because it can actually crystallize) is a great alternative. It has 2 calories per gram, a Glycemic Index of 2, and a slightly less cooling affect than any of the other sugar alcohol.My ultimate advice is that you do your research beyond the Amazon comment section before you ingest any ingredient that you are unfamiliar with.","[""100% PURE XYLITOL XyloSweet is a 100% pure xylitol sweetener derived from the fibrous parts of plants, similar in taste to regular organic sugar.

We’d rather use real shaving cream than use the stuff this kit comes with on our little one’s skin.Hard to find shaving kit stuff for kids. They love this one though. Recommend.It's a very cute set. My little boy loves mimicking dad. However, the ""mirror"" didn't stay stuck to the yellow plastic. Other than that it's great!We substituted a tin of real wet shave hard soap, a soap cup, and an old brush of mine. 4year old loves loading the brush, making a lather, applying and using the supplied razor.The mirror is cheap and was already not adhered to the yellow plastic so I threw it away as it was a safety hazard. The other items all were great and my daughter loves them.My son loves to shave with me as I get ready for work. We used to use a disposable razor with the clear cap glued on, but I always worried that it would come off. Since we found this kit, I don’t have to worry! He can shave his “whiskers” off right along side me, with no fear of accidental cuts. We couldn’t be happier with this purchase.The mirror was detached from the base when it arrived, but other than that it was fine. Easy fix. Adorable shave toyMy son shaves every time he takes a bath! It’s definitely a fun bonding tool. Love it!My young, autistic, son recently started watching me shave, going so far as to dip his hands in the water and cover his face with some of the foam. There's no way I would let him handle a real razor, so I started looking to see if any kind of suitable, safe, substitute existed. I didn't honestly expect to find something, but then I saw this set. It arrived very quickly, and I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of it. The 'razor' is, indeed, completely safe, and the brush was of a much higher quality than I expected. He hasn't used it yet (it will be part of his Christmas bundle) so I can't comment on the foam provided with it, as some others have. Overall, I am delighted with this product, and look forward to him standing beside me, mimicking with his safe razor my actions as I shave.I have bought this product for my toddler, excellent product, shaving like a grown up :)Good value for money, but took a few weeks for delivery due to it being sent from abroad, but the company are good and gave a realistic delivery date, but just keep it in mind if your ordering for birthday present, order early.All his friend love it, so have gave lots out as birthday presents, great gift :)I would & have recommended to friends.My four year old love's this little set, brought it for him when I caught him taking the lid off daddy's razor. This little set enables him to be just like his daddy and shave his pretend beard. He loves the pot and brush, which I put foam in and the little mirror for doing funny shapes. So, danger averted and I would HIGHLY recommend! XxMy sons love this item as it is great fun for them to pretend to be like dad. I think the mirror could be slightly larger with a stand or suction at the back as there is nothing to hold it up.My 5 year old boy loves this!! It's a nice simple toy that he can play with in the bath or at the sink. It's a bit messy though as the foam can get everywhere. The only downside though is that the mirror is very small and hasn't got a stand so is quite fiddly to look into and hold at the same time for a 5 year old","[""Pretend play shaving kit for the tub"",""Have some good, clean fun"",""Lather up for shave just like Daddy does"",""Includes plastic play razor, shaving brush, unbreakable mirror, comb and Foaming Body Soap"",""Recommended for children 3 years of age and older""]"

I don’t seem to have headaches or nausea or heartburn with these. Great energy boost. I will buy againMy daughter has been struggling with multiple illnesses starting with Lymes Disease then Epsteem Barr Virus for approximately 5 years now. She has been taking Host Defense Cordyceps for most of that time. Periodically I try what appears to be a cheaper brand, but when we take it into her chiropractor who does muscle testing they are never as potent. She then has to take more per day, thus causing them to be just as expensive, and in some cases more expensive than the Host Defense brand. I only buy Host Defense Cordyceps now.Among the myriad suppliments she is taking is a product called Total Brain by Nutri-West. It seems to work synergistically with the cordyceps. Any time we get off the proper dosage of one or the other of these 2 suppliments for more than 5 days, her energy dramatically declines and her headaches worsen.She is finally starting to creep back to health. Anthony Williams' book Medical Medium has provided suppliment suggestions that have been key to her recovery, but they take time. We discovered his book a little over a year ago and only recently have we started seeing improvements.In the beginning of her illness, we cured the Lymes disease with 2 herbal tinctures working in tandem. A potent Cat's Claw (Sorry I don't have the knowledge of a potent brand. We got ours through our chiropractor. I did take the Nutrimedix brand in to muscle test and it was worthless.) and Teasel Root.Love to all and thank you to Host Defense for making a quality product.I love this product. I feel great , positive and full of energy... this pills don't smell bad and don't have any bad taste ...This company Came in highly recommended, tried 3 products from them for few months. Probably will stop the cycle soon as don't noticed any mentioned results.My dog has a slow growing malignant tumor. He is 10 years old, and the only way to be sure we would get rid of the cancer is to remove his leg. He is a large dog and in no pain so we checked with three different vets: a holistic one, our regular vet, and an oncologist and arrived at a course of treatment. He gets a largely meat and vegetable diet, a multivitamin, probiotics, CO Q 10, and fish oil, All three vets recommended Cordyceps so I did some research, and I have been taking it myself too. To tell you the truth, it seems to give me a little more energy, but that could be a placebo effect.Anyway, my husband has been measuring the tumor daily with calipers and putting the measurement in a spread sheet. The tumor has remained exactly the same size or maybe even a little smaller since it popped up 6 months ago. I have no idea what is keeping it in check, but I am not going to stop this regimen.In addition to the holistic routine, he also gets a small chemo pill daily. I seems to have no side effects at all, but, of course, it might be what is keeping the cancer in checkApril 7, 2015 - Just back from a visit to the oncologist. Tumor has grown a very small amount. Toby's blood work is fine. He is now also getting Turkey Tail and Milk Thistle in addition to the previously mentioned regimen.. He has been being treated for the tumor 14 months now, and it is still not bothering him. He is now 11.good for energyI really like this natural product and have found that there are many ways that medicinal mushrooms can help people, and this one is among the best.If you're in perfect health you may not notice anything but take it from someone who has had multiple heart surgeries this stuff works and works fast! 20 minutes after I feel %100 better EVERY TIME!Used it for improvement","[""ENERGIZE YOUR PERFORMANCE: Traditionally used to support energy, stamina and athletic performance; Promotes healthy kidney function"",""GET MORE OUT OF EVERY BREATH: Helps improve oxygen uptake and prepares your body for activity; An ideal choice for athletes and fitness enthusiasts looking for a natural edge"",""TAKE 2 CAPSULES DAILY: Can be taken with food or without, and even on an empty stomach"",""CONVENIENT, ONE-A-DAY: Simple and convenient, our vegetarian capsules are an excellent daily source of mushroom mycelium"",""SAFE, SMART MUSHROOMS: Sustainably cultivated, certified organic and U.S. grown mushrooms from the forest, to our farm, to you""]"

Not at all disappointed that I did, I really like the whole album. Was playing it with my sister in the car and commented that they reminded my a lot of the Dixie Chicks and she said"" I thought that is who it was!"" Having never heard the song before, she was singing along to the chorus of Shut Up before the it was over. Stay on Your Side of Town is in the vein of Sin Wagon, one of my all time favorite DC songs and I smile every time I listen to it again.Of course, the radio hits are there too, like ""Girl in a Country Song"" and ""Fly"", but really, every song on this album could be a hit. The lyrics are clever and memorable. The harmony is great, the songs have real melodies and genuine country feel with fiddle, banjo and (I believe) steel guitar making contributions, and there are some pretty good regular guitar parts too.I never feel like these girls are screaming at me, a common problem with many of the ""big"" female country stars in my opinion.

BRINDLE Waterproof Memory Foam Pet Bed - Removable and Washable Cover - 4 Inch Orthopedic Dog and Cat Bed - Fits Most Crates,Brindle,"Give your pet a soft, comfortable, and durable place to snooze. The BRINDLE Memory Foam Pet Bed features two inches of orthopedic memory foam layered on top of two inches of high-density support foam. The soft, conforming memory foam is super comfortable and helps relieve achy joints, arthritis, and hip dysplasia. Perfect as a bed for a dog or cat, this pet bed is made of durable material with a waterproof inner layer to protect from accidents, messes, and lingering smells. You can easily remove the zippered cover, and it is machine washable for easy care. The bed is available in three colors and three sizes, and a non-skid bottom helps keep the bed in place. There are a few things to consider when choosing a pet bed for your best friend, like where you will use the bed and how your pet sleeps. If you plan to use it in the kennel or in the car, you'll want to measure the exact space the bed will fill. Many BRINDLE pet beds are conveniently designed to fit standard kennel dimensions. If you are using the bed in an open space, like your living room or bedroom, consider your pet's sleep position. If your pet sleeps curled up, a small, cozy bed is ideal. If your pet stretches out, you may want to size up. A general rule is to measure your dog from nose to rump and add 10 inches.","[""Pet Supplies"",""Cats"",""Beds & Furniture"",""Beds""]",Brindle,Pet Supplies,"This a great quality dog bed.

Its a nice high quality fabric and comes with a little matching carrying case which was so nice to have!This bag pairs quite well with a rolling bag and specifically has a ""pocket"" intended to be used alongside a rolling luggage.I know this because hindsight tells me.This bag is intended as a pairing with a rolling bag, and I suspect that when designing the bag, they were thinking users wouldn't be strictly /carrying/ this luggage. I sadly dont own rolling luggage.It is a fantastic piece of luggage. I definitely got full use out of all pockets and features this bag offers, and was able to fit everything I wanted to bring (plus a few more things) because of how much space there is. There is a shoe compartment that fit my socks and shoes. I used the garment bag portion (with 2 hangers) which has snaps at the bottom to hold the garment in place. The small pockets on the inside of the bag fit some of my travel-sized goods. The side pockets had a location for my travel pen, and I put my emergency contact+ info there just in case. I had enough space (paired with a second bag) for my entire trip, and this bag fit more of my larger items.I really like this bag.However, having had to strictly carry this bag during my recent travel, without a rolling bag to pair alongside, I noticed the bag itself suffers some pain points. The handles, while durable did fray during the trip, but after I got home I used my lighter to remove them without issue. The zippers have a snapping functionality to ensure the bag doesnt open while traveling, but there were gaps very easily seen and potentially grabbed at where the zippers connected. I personally didn't have any issues while traveling, but it did feel slightly uneasy in larger crowded areas. The shoulder strap connectors attached to the bag and the strap itself are not set in place, which caused the connectors to twist and bunch-up the strap at the connector point. The was A) annoying because the shoulder pad wouldnt sit properly and B) concerned me about the straps longevity when stressed.Overall, I will be using this bag again for many trips in the future. I think its a fantastic idea and well executed for the most part. (I will be looking into getting a carry-on rolling bag someday, that said.)I recently got this bag because I needed to transport a suit and some dress shirts across the country for a friend's wedding. The bag is cleverly designed to be a garment bag but then can zip up partway into a duffel bag. There are also numerous pockets for odds and ends, as well as a removable shoulder strap.As a garment bag, it works okay. You do have to carefully lay the items into the garment section, to minimize any creases and folds. The bottom does not unzip all the way, so you cannot just lay down the clothes and then zip them back up. You have to make sure that your clothing tucks in neatly, or it will crease. I was able to easily fit a suit jacket, three pairs of slacks, and three dress shirts. When I arrived at my destination, there were only minimal creases on a couple of the dress shirts and the slacks. My hotel room had an iron so I could work those out, but it would have looked fine if I had left it alone.With the sides zipped up, it becomes a serviceable duffel bag, and I was able to fit four t-shirts, three pairs of shorts, my toiletry kit, and a second pair of shoes (there is also a side shoe pocket).You do have to zip the thing up carefully, I was worried about getting some of the bag folds or clothing caught in the zipper. If any of the zippers get stuck or break, it very likely will make the bag difficult to use for its intended purpose. That said, I feel it was a pretty good value for the money I spent. I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for an inexpensive garment bag.I have used a much larger garment bag for years but found it had torn and I needed a replacement in a hurry. This bag arrived in just one day in a box which seemed too small, but what I didn’t realize is that this bag can be folded to be very compact when empty and has ample room for two full suits, two dress shirts, two pairs of shoes and all of my accessories and travel toiletries. I was even able to slide my laptop between the garment roll and the inner compartment. Construction seems satisfactory and I don’t doubt that this bag will last for years if well cared for. On arrival it was easy to hang my clothes which looked as good as fresh from the cleaners.Recent trip out of state, and I saw a similar garment bag on Instagram. This item allowed me to hang some clothing I didn't want to wrinkle. It then rolls up to become a duffle bag. I was able to fit some folded shirts and a pair of shoes. This garment/duffle hybrid had more pockets than I knew how to handle. Getting thru security was a breeze. My go-to travel bag going forwardNice bag, look forward to using it on the next trip. Already tried it out by putting in the suit, shoes, and other items to complete the wardrobe, and works great. I ordered the black one however, for some reason I got the gray one. However, due to it looks great decided to keep.Went on a trip where I needed a suit, sports coat, pants and shirts. There was a total of 10 items. When I got there the suits were fine… slight wrinkle on the starched shirts, but it really worked! My only problem was finding a hanger that was short enough to hold the clothing, but would fit snugly against the top of the bag. I had a couple from an old suit bag so I used those. If a couple were included that would be great!The zippers required gentle use, but they all worked and were strong enough to make it.I used it as my only bag for carry on on an international flight to attend a funeral. The only reason I gave it a lower score for travel was the shoulder strap. It needs a wider thicker strap.I love to cruise but I hate having to pack a suit or a jacket for dinners. Also, the current state of air travel makes me hesitant to check luggage because the flights get changed and your checked bags don't make it to the destination when you do. This is a great carry-on for cruise and business travel. I cut the hooks off 3 rubber hangers and velcro'd them to the suit loop so I could hang shirts, pants, and jackets. It was the perfect upgrade.I used the bag pretty soon after getting it and was very pleased with the results. I had a suit, shirt and my wife’s long dress in the zip up section and they came out without any noticeable creases. My shoes fitted nicely in the shoe section.There was still room to put other things in the bag, but I tried to not to go overboard so as not to risk creasing the main garments.I would say that it is only for use as an overnight bag because of the limitations when you fill the zip section. I will be using it again shortly and will be confident that the main clothes will be protected from creasing.Bought this last minute as I was travelling up to a weekend wedding by train and needed something for my suit, shoes, laptop and extra’s. It did an amazing job. It was heavy but only because I overloaded it. It was strong and performed it job well. If it had wheels I would have been set. I highly recommend this bag and I will definitely be using it more often now.An OK solution to avoiding crumpled suits during travelling. Bag is OK quality and a little cheap looking but is very lightweight. Does a reasonable job of what it's designed to do.Items more or less wrinkle free, good quality would get another if the situation required.Great product thank you 😊","[""TWO BAG IN ONE MODOKER BAG; With the fancy design of combining the feature of Garment Bag and Duffel Bag, Modoker Garment Duffel Bag is not only a Overnight Travel Weekender Bag, but also a great Duffel Hanging Clothes Bag.

TORRO Magnetic Case Compatible with iPad Mini 6th Gen 2021 - Genuine Leather Cover with [Multiple Viewing Angles] [Wake/Sleep Enabled] (Black),TORRO,,"[""Electronics"",""Computers & Accessories"",""Tablet Accessories"",""Bags, Cases & Sleeves"",""Cases""]",‎B.A.M Worldwide ltd,,"the cover adds extremely little weight or bulk to the svelte naked ipad mini 6 and it makes the ipad easier to hold/grab. Because of the magnet connection to adhere the ipad to the cover (which is plenty strong - no issues there), all the function buttons and fingerprint sensor are properly exposed. The flap covering the pencil is ideal and that flap folds back flat and is secured magnetically when you have the front cover folded back. It is pebbly finished leather (but that is indistinguishable from ""real pu leather"" (what an oxymoron).Very minimalistic, adds very little weight and thickness to the iPad.Just got mine a few hours ago, coming from the apple version. I love the leather, looks and feels great. I also appreciate how they put 2 magnets where the latch closes, so it locks in place with or without the Apple Pencil. It’s all about the details. My only worry is the magnets. I read all the reviews saying they were weak but decided to send it anyways. They are not as bad as some of the reviews made it seem, though compared to the apple one you can definitely notice a difference. Just means you have to be careful with your $600 device, as you should already be doing. Don’t trust the magnets to save your device. Wouldn’t trust the apple one like that either. Solid product. Wish they had it with the red stitching like the other model, but the black is clean. Give it a try if you’re willing to be careful with your device. Will update if magnets lose any noticeable strength over time.The magnets work perfectly, been using it for almost a month now, and my iPad had never fallen off or slid out of place. I am not super satisfied with the leather tho, as it feels a bit too rough to the touch, plasticky even. It does look and smells like real leather, I guess, but the quality of said leather doesn't strike me as a super-quality one.Up side is nice quality casecand good power shut off.A bit pricey but it's leather and looks good. Hey, still cheaper than Apple with quality fit and finish.Fine leather construction with an open-sided design for maximum access to flush mounted top buttons. Unlike earlier designs that had a retaining surround with access holes, this case relies on weak magnets embedded in the back to secure the iPad. It’s fairly easy to dislodge the iPad if you’re careless. Otherwise a thin, light weight leather case that should hold up well.I like that it is very purpose built. It does a great job of protecting the ipad while at the same time staying out of the way and unobtrusive . The trifold design of the cover does a great job at doubling As a stand. I use the ipad mainly as a source of music for headphone listening.The overall quality of the look and feel of this case is wonderful! It is a small footprint, with no extra bulk and it is sleek and easy to hold. The magnetic closure keeps everything secure. Regarding the ""hold"" of the magnet . . . I agree with many of the other reviews in that it just doesn't hold very well. Every time I open the magnetic flap closure and go to open the front cover, the back cover peels off instead. Also, when I am using the iPad and I hold it vertical, it sometimes just falls off the magnetic back. I love the design, so I am living with it, but maybe not much longer. Wish they would fix this.Having tried some cheaper cases, the Torro feels superior in its function and quality. Both the front and rear of the iPad is nicely protected, with the magnetic case holding the pad nicely in position. However, when opening the case you need to be sure you open the case cover and don’t grip the iPad otherwise the case will break free.The magnets are sturdy once the iPad is seated. The overall quality of the case is excellent with a magnetic flap ensuring the case remains closed when not in use.To improve I’d suggest corner protection could be incorporated, this would also ensure you don’t accidentally detach the iPad from the case when opening.To conclude, I’d highly recommend this case, cheaper options just feel inferior while the official Apple case is simply too expensive.This is a very nice, sleek, good quality case for iPad Pro. It would not prevent an accident if the iPad was to fall on a concrete floor, but it certainly provides a good overall protection from scratches, and does the job of a good folio case, i.e. stand.It's made of real, good quality leather, it's super light, and uses magnets to stick to the back of the ipad, leaving every side of the tablet completely free which I love.The case securely folds round my Ipad Mini, the magnets holding it firmly in place. Good quality, and works well, the only concerns I have are that you have to ensure the device is fitted correctly otherwise it can slip out of the bottom of the case. Only purchased the case this week, so will see how it goes.overall well made but be aware your iPad mini can fall out when you open up not every time but doesnt always hold in case securely normally all of the Torro products i have had have been excellent this looks the part butLove it. Originally got a cheap cover which didn’t sit right with how lovely my iPad is so got this worth it and is sturdy and safe.

Nothing in the stores comes in my size. I’m now a 44F, though I was closer to a 44DD in high school. I recently got a few sports bras from Amazon to try. They all fit, but one was one of those “comfy” bras that can’t actually offer support during a workout, another gave me cone shaped boobs that were very noticeable under shirts (think bullet bra), and then there was this one. Seeing the reviews, I decided to buy a cup size up (44G). I can get it on and it holds everything in place. Literally no bounce. However, the straps really dig in and it is a struggle to hook and get the straps over my shoulders. So I decided to size up even more in both band and cup size to a 46H. This one is much easier to get on and more comfortable to wear, though there is a little bounce. I’m going to keep both and will use the smaller one for more high impact workouts while the larger one will be for more laid back stuff. This is the only sports bras I’ve found that will actually hold boobs larger than a D cup and doesn’t look strange. I also like that the front panel (grey in the ones I got) is adjustable to add just a bit more support or coverage. My two complaints are sizing and the straps. If you don’t want to stick with 2 bras like me, I recommend going up at least a band and cup size. Sizing is very small. I think the straps are also dependent on cup size, and therefore small. I have them extended all the way on both bras. On the 44G bra, it’s difficult to get my arms through the straps and they can leave red marks from digging into my shoulders. I haven’t worn the 46H for an extended period of time, but it was already much easier to get on. However, beauty (and working out) is pain and this bras actually supports me while holding my chest in place, which is very rare for my size.",null

The detective agreed with me that it happened and probably who did it as I saw the person on my doorbell camera but not recorded. The police said they can't do anything so I took my safety in my own hands. I had a dorbell camera but it's not going to catch anything inside the security door which 4 other apartments can let anyone in I searched I for a month for a camera I could afford and has the features I need. I ended up on this camera. It is so perfect nobody would dare to touch my door I also bought 3 deadbolt sliders for my bedroom door which left me with an issue. If I'm barricaded in my room and hear noises , how can I tell if someone is out there. It basically negated the deadbolts because I would need to unlock them to check on the noise. I bought a highly rated cheaper camera which I can look to see if anyone is in the kitchen. I had it for 1 day and the camera was good and served it's purpose to look outside my locked bedroom door. The important thing it did not give me was the price of mind that this camera did. I returned the other camera and bought a second one of this camera. All of these cameras , stun gun and deadbolts now I have peice of mind . I can blast a strobe light and alarm as loud as a police siren, I can talk to anyone I'm not sure why they are there with eye popping quality. Most important is I never have to work about missing a recording if someone does happen because it record automatically when it detects motion and let's the recording stay in the cloud free looping for 7 days you can set it many ways, the wifi signal is as strong as my foth and it's virtually impossible for someone to take it because you have to know how first, second your cought in camera doing it and 3rd I'll blast thier eardrums out that they will run away.

"R-Go Split Ergonomic Keyboard, QWERTY (US), Black, Wired USB Keyboard (QWERTY (US) / Spilt, Wired/Windows, Linux)",R-Go Tools,"R-GO TOOLS ERGONOMIC SPLIT KEYBOARD R-GO TOOLS ERGONOMIC SPLIT KEYBOARD Chances are you have a kink in the wrists while typing. That happens automatically when you use a standard keyboard. In order to be able to type with straight wrists, we have developed an ergonomic split keyboard that consists of two separate parts. These parts can be placed freely on the desk so that you can type in a healthy way in any working position. Our keyboards stand out for their minimal thickness. A flat keyboard provides a flat, relaxed position for the hands. This way the tendons in the wrists are relieved and the blood circulation in your hands remains intact. The special scissor mechanism in the keys provides a light keystroke, so you need less power to type. Do you also find it difficult that, if you are right-handed, with a standard keyboard you always have to reach sideways to the mouse? By constantly reaching out with your right arm, you can burden your wrist and shoulder unnoticed. To avoid overloading, it is important to keep both hands within shoulder width. That’s why our ergonomic keyboards are designed to be compact. R-GO SPLIT BREAK KEYBOARD CONNECTION FOR R-GO NUMPAD PAUSE: There are USB ports on two sides of the keyboard for the R-Go numpad break. COMPACT, LIGHT MODEL: Never reach sideways for your mouse again. Easy to transport, so ideal for travel. BUILT-IN MAGNET: Transform your split keyboard into a compact keyboard in one swift movement. SMALL DESIGN: A perfect design for relaxed, flat wrists when typing. EASY KEY PRESS: The special scissors mechanism in the keys ensures a light keystroke. RECYCLED PLASTIC: This keyboard is made from recycled plastic. PATENTED PAUSE INDICATOR. Read more ERGONOMIC KEYBOARD WITH PAUSE DISPLAY The patented R-Go Break software uses color signals to indicate when it is time to take a break. As you type, the light changes color like a traffic light: Green: All right! Orange: time for a short break. Red: You worked too long. This way you will receive positive feedback about your break behavior. Read more NEVER REACH FOR MOUSE AGAIN WITH R-GO COMPACT/SPLIT KEYBOARD When using both keyboard and mouse at the same time, your hands always stay within shoulder width. This natural posture reduces muscle tension in your shoulder and arm and prevents RSI complaints.

My Caps Lock key is only working for the left side of the keyboard. The Shift-keys are only working for the same part of the keyboard, not for both sides. Can this be fixed? A. You're probably using a system with macOS installed on it. Unfortunately, macOS doesn't let the computer use two keyboards (parts) with one wire which causes the issue that some keys on the one part, aren't working for the other part. But, this can be fixed. Follow the steps below: Download the application Karabiner-Elements here Install the application and open it. Make sure you are on the tab named 'Simple Modifications' at the top of the window. At the bottom left side, you see a button named 'Add item'. Click on it, and you will see a new line appear in the field above the button. Under 'From key', click on the selector and select 'left_shift'. Now click on the selector under 'To key' and select 'right_shift'. Click 'Add item' at the bottom left side again, a new line will show up in the field above. Under 'From key', click on the newest selector and select 'right_shift'. Now click on the newest selector under 'To key' and select 'left_shift'. Your keyboard should work fine now. If it is still not working, try to reboot your computer or send a message through ""ask seller"" on Amazon. Q. I get the following error: ""The last USB device you connected malfunctioned, Windows does not recognize it"", what should I do? A. Press or click the windows button in the left down corner of your screen, then search for ""Bluetooth and other devices"" and click the result. You will be redirected to the settings screen. Click on the USB Keyboard driver and delete it. Then disconnect and redirect the keyboard to your devices. The drivers will be reinstalled and everything should work now. Q . Is it possible to turn off the light in the upper left corner? A. Yes, this is possible. You can do so by pressing the keycombination ""Fn""+""A"". If the light is already turned off and you want to turn it on again, you can press the same combination to do so. Q. The right side of my keyboard types numbers instead of the letters u,i,o,j,k,l and m. How can I fix this? A. When this happens, the internal numpad of the keyboard has been activated. You can turn this off by pressing the Num Lock key on the keyboad. This key is located on the top row, the third key from the right. Q. Why is this keyboard so flat, that is not ergonomic right? A . Our keyboards are made as flat and thin as possible due to ergonomical reasons. When you use a keyboard with a height adjuster underneath you bend your wrists in order to reach all the keys. By bending your wrists, you block the blood circulation going through your hands. That is why our keyboards are flat and thin so the blood circulation to your wrists does not get blocked.

I was looking for a thin split keyboard to make a portable ergonomic rig for travel.This keyboard fits the bill as it is very slim. In spite of the thinness, the key travel is significant and feels very good. There's no wobble in the keys. If you're familiar with Dell XPS, Macbook Pro (2015 and 2018), and modern Thinkpad laptops, this feels most like a Thinkpad X1 or T460 keyboard. Solid and comfortable.A nice surprise was that the casing is made of brushed metal, not plastic, it feels very durable and doesn't move around on a desk.The one think I would change is the Enter key, which is like a very skinny ISO Enter, and the placement of /? and \|. Its easy to hit those keys when you're trying to hit Enter and Shift. It takes some getting used to. The 6 key is on the right half, which is standard if you've learned to type 6 with the right hand, but may be surprising to some as many splits have the 6 on the left half.The halves connect with a micro-usb to micro-usb cable, and two are included in case you lose or break one or want to connect the Ergoguys numpad (which canbe connected on either side, a nice touch for lefties). A standard OTG cable also works.All in all, this is one of the better split keyboards I've used, with exceptional quality construction and key feel, and a uniquely slim design that makes it very portable. I'm taking one star off for the three key placement issues above; but the rest of the keyboard makes up for it. This is the best portable solution I've found so far; it's compact enough there's no reason to travel without a split keyboard and endure pain from typing on a standard laptop. That alone is well worth the learning curve, and the keyboard pays for itself as it saves me from having to see an occupational therapist or of take time off work because of RSI.Highly recommended.I was very excited to get this keyboard. It is very sharp and cool looking but it doesn't quite meet my expectations of a keyboard that cost this much money. Here's why:1. When you use the SHIFT keys, you have to use the SHIFT key that is on the same side of the keyboard. If you want to hold SHIFT on the left side and then press keys on the right side of the keyboard, it doesn't work. This is very inconvenient. :(2. You have to hit the keys harder than what i am used to so that the keystroke is registered. (not a deal breaker)3. The keyboard uses a rubber-like material around the keys and the rest of the top of the keyboard. This material shows dirt and oils from your fingers very quickly. After my first day of use, my keyboard looked gross. I am basically having to clean it daily. Maybe I should be cleaning my keyboard daily anyway, but I've never seen a keyboard appear this dirty so quickly!4. Sometimes the keyboard jus stops working. To fix this, just unplug and plug it back in and it works. not sure if its my computer or the keyboard itself. (I'm using a MacBook Pro 2015)This was THE keyboard really. Loved it's compactness yet enough place for my fingers to roam, silent as it could be , perfect height for my palm pads, delete is separte key from backup and placed where it should be. Escape button placed exactly where it shpuld be. Very ergonomic.Then why 2 stars?Cause they messed up with the two most used keys placement. For absolutely no reason. The enter key must be above the shift key in HORIZONTAL size. They could just leave the pipe and slash button above the enter key as is the pattern. Everytime i went to hit wnter it just gave me a slash and when you are to write a 10k words essay IT IS FRUSTRATING. Same on the left side. I don't need two pipe and slash buttons!!! It messes up the SHIFT keys placement and typing. This is the biggest issue and I was tempted tomjust guve 1 star. But it is a very good product otherwise.*** If they fix this I'll buy it again in a an instant!This is just very close to the perfect keyboard for me. I love the simplicity of the design and the split. As far as I can tell, it's the best design on the market for a compact, low-profile butterfly-switch split keyboard. The keys are comfy with very quick action and low noise despite a very clear actuation feel.Reliability:I bought two. the first had a sticky 'O' key, and the second only lasted a few months before it started malfunctioning every once in a while - multiple times a day, the right side would stop working. Generally I had to unplug the right from the left and re-plug it and it would start working again, but eventually I couldn't get it to start working again.Key placement issues:I agree with some of the key placement issues raised by others, in particular the outdated vertical Enter key. Horizontal is better and more common in the US. I contacted their product department and they said this is because they share the mold with other international layouts that don't have the horizontal Enter.I also dislike the fact that Num Lock is shared between this and my 10-key... it means whenever I want to use my 10-key for entering numbers, the keyboard becomes useless because much of the right side starts typing numbers instead of letters.The switches are pretty good for scissors and the metal frame makes it feel high quality. The layout is questionable though, especially the left shift key for me.Pro:1. Quality material. Metal frame makes it feel high quality.2. Good scissor switches. They are crips and responsive.3. Thin profile is a pro IMO.Cons:1. Questionable layout. Why is there a key between the left shift and z?2. Price is on the high side.3. Micro usb is minor, but it should be usb-c for the price.4. Not 100% sure because I only use it for a few minutes but I don't think it had legs to tilt it. This could be an issue for some users.A coworker recommended getting a split keyboard after I mentioned having neck pains, but I didn't want a mechanical keyboard. This was the closest I could find to the Apple keyboards I was already using - I bought the US model as it's closer to the Apple UK layout. It does need a bit of extra setup on a Mac, but the instructions for how to install and configure Karabiner-Elements are clear and easy to follow, and it also lets you remap the keys to be more like the Apple layout. It's a little stiffer than the keyboard it replaced, but I think that's to be expected given the old one was nearly ten years old!I do miss having a numeric keypad. The R-GO website lists one as an add-on, but I haven't seen it available anywhere. I hope they release it soon!Oh, and I've only had it a few weeks, but I haven't had a stiff neck since switching to this keyboard. So, fingers crossed, it's working!I bought this keyboard back in January and used it pretty often; the keyboard itself is good for typing, however, the cabling is pretty faulty; every time you move your keyboard it disconnects from the computer between each side. After 8 months the right side stopped working, I tried using different cabling as it has happened before, but this time it seems that the right side got faulty completed. Customer support neither is the best. I DO not recommend buying this productThat is all I can say, the microUSB soldering is probably loose on the inside of the keyboard. Sometimes only the right side works, sometimes the whole keyboard doesn't work. This started happening yesterday.Das R-Go Keyboard hat eine hervorragende Haptik, der Anschlag ist gut, die Tastatur flach und eben - ähnlich meiner Cherry G85. Die Teilung der Tastatur ist gut gewählt. Ich tippe normalerweise auch Tasten links mit der rechten Hand und umgekehrt; das geht jetzt nicht mehr und trotzdem ich habe die Teilung nicht als störend empfunden. Die Hände liegen ausgestreckt gerade ueber den Tastenfeldern, je nach persönlicher Vorliebe angeordnet. Das funktioniert gut. Die Verarbeitung ist gut, die Hälften passen genau zusammen. Die Tastatur ist schwer genug, so daß sie nicht aus Versehen beim Schreiben verrutscht.Allerdings gibt es einige Punkte, mit denen ich nicht so gut zurechtkomme,1. die rechte Hälfte der Tastatur funktioniert nicht mit meinem Aten CS1764A KVMP Switch. Anscheined ist das ein bekanntes Problem, denn in der Anleitung wird darauf hingewiesen, daß die Tastatur nicht an einem USB Hub betrieben werden soll, sondern direkt am Computer. Für mich bedeutet es, daß ich die Tastatur nicht zum Umschalten zwischen mehreren Rechnern nutzten kann.2. Der auf der Tastatur blau markierte Zehnerblock funktioniert nicht.3. Die Home/End/PgUp/PgDn Tasten sind auf der linken Seite oben untergebracht, und erfordern Handgymnastik, denn dort ist auch die Fn Taste. Fuer kompliziertere Manöver, wie das Markieren von Text bis an den Anfang, brauche ich dann Shift, Fn und Home, alles auf der linken Seite.4. Die Tastatur ist kompakt, d.h. der Pfeiltastenblock ist nicht mehr separat. Das ist schade, denn gerade beim Arbeiten mit Excel oder beim Programmieren brauche ich die Pfeiltasten und Home/End/PgUp/PgDn ständig. Ich hätte mir die Pfeiltasten und Home/End/PgUp/PgDn als abgesetzte Tasten auf der rechten Seite gewünscht.Fuer Menschen, die viel Text schreiben, und Schreibmaschinentechnik beherrschen, einen Versuch wert. Ich habe sie jedoch aus den genannten Gründen zurückgegeben.El teclado es malo, es solo un teclado partido por la mitad, asi que realmente ergonomico no es (las teclas siguen en una hilera rigida, no se puede elevar un poco, no trae apoyo para las munyecas). Tiene algunas fallas de disenyo tambien. La tecla del espacio del lado izquierdo esta mal ubicado para diestros, algunas combinaciones de teclas no salen facilmente (es una loteria ver si el shift izquierdo va a funcionar o no). Con eso en mente, es una buena introduccion al teclado partido para dar el salto a un teclado verdaderamente ergonomico. Pero viendo que es carisimo el teclado, mejor ahorrar 150 mas y comprar algun teclado mecanico/ergonomico que sea mejor.","[""* SPLIT KEYBOARD- The keyboard consists of two separate parts - The two components can be placed in any desired position.

The heater is built for use with 120 volts AC, drawing 3.33 amps thus producing 400 watts. It has a preset thermostat set for 90 ºF / 32 ºC (± 10 ºF / 5 ºC). The PBL420 band-style cylinder heaters allow you to draw propane at increased rates in cold weather conditions versus an unheated cylinder. You can run one band or add a second one further up the cylinder to improve the performance of the gas delivery system even more. This innovative heat-spreading technology insulates, protects and maintains heat to help you keep your pressure up and reduce the frequency of cylinder refills.Powerblanket Lite line is designed for heating jobs on a smaller scale. These models feature a lower power density than Powerblanket Industrial or Powerblanket Xtreme products. Rest assured that these heaters are the real deal! They are more efficient and safer than other heating elements on the market and certified to ETL, UL, CSA & CE safety standards. Keep your drums, barrels, buckets, pails & gas cylinder propane tanks warm in bitter climates so that you don't lose any production time, saving you both time and money.On those occasions when you don’t need all the extra strength and durability, however, there’s no use paying for more than you need, right? That’s why we created our Lite line. For those jobs that don’t necessitate the most robust and sturdy application possible, the Powerblanket Lite line is the best answer.","[""Industrial & Scientific"",""Material Handling Products"",""Drum & Pail Handling Equipment"",""Heaters""]",‏  ‎ Powerblanket,,"Excellent product IMO. We use this in an RV to heat a 20 pound cylinder. Tank pressure (per one of those cheap gauges that you screw into the tank outlet) would register into the ""yellow"" area, indicating tank pressure was low. After adding this blanket, pressure would bounce back into the ""green"" zone, just like a full tank on a hot day. I know. Those gauges don't get a lot of respect, but it's what I have, so I'm passing along the information. On a cold night without the blanket and a partially empty tank, it's likely that our RV furnace would have been starved for fuel after running for awhile, so it would probably have shut off before the RV got warm even though there was propane in the tank. This blanket keeps the liquid warm enough to continue producing good pressure down to the end of the tank. I've used it now through several months of the coldest parts of the winter, and have not had any issues with the blanket or with keeping the tank warm. Very happy.I use this product as a companion to a Mr. Heater propane space heater. What attracted me to this product was, small propane tanks losing efficiency in extreme temperatures. Last winter, we had several episodes where the tank would freeze up, the regulator would seize, and our only choice was to bring the tank inside to warm it up so that we could use our Mr. Heater heater. We've had this thing since mid November. Last night was the first MAJOR test, with 13 degree weather. It worked flawlessly. The blanket doesn't get so hot that you get scared to use it. It just provides passive steady heat- just enough to keep your tank unfrozen. The price was also a major attraction. Typically these blankets cost hundreds of dollars more. Would Recommend. Also, we bought a heavy duty extension cord to use this thing, but it turned out to be unneeded. The cord is quite long.For the price I would've expected more performance. The build quality is high and it fits the tanks well. It's just that if you're planning on using this to keep an LP tank warmish in a real winter (below zero °F) it's not gonna keep up. It doesn't even keep the snow off itself at about 10°F. Overall a good product if only it was powerful enough to keep up when you really need to keep the tank temp up for a heater. Maybe I'll add more insulation and reevaluate.I purchased this item to use with my infrared gill I recently bought from Woot. As I’ve always grilled year-round I knew that the new gill would probably not work when it got below 40F. The LP would not vaporized fast enough to keep the grill going. My first usage of the blanket was at an air temp of 32F, with all three burners going at full blast I had plenty of fuel. With and IR temperature probe I measured a temp of around 65F on the top of the tank just above the blanket.The real test came about a week ago when the outside air temp had been below zero for a day or so. When I went out to get the grill setup and to plug in the blanket the air temp was 3F. Fifteen to twenty minutes later I checked the tank temperature and was getting a reading of around 34F. Fired up the grill and let it heat up for 10-15 minutes before putting on the meat, at that point the tank was reading in the low to mid 40s F.Needless to say I am very happy with my purchase and highly recommend it to anyone wanting to gill in the winter. One thing of note the product photos show and somewhere in one of the comments the power cord was stated as being only two foot long. The unit I received has a 15 foot power cord, which is a good length. Much better then what I was expecting.It helps to mitigate the issue, but I wouldn’t say it solves the problem completely. My tank still freezes up, it just takes longer.I've bought blankets like this for years from a number of suppliers. In this particular order, I ordered two blankets. One blanket performed beautifully. The second blanket only got hot on the lower portion of the blanket. I was concerned that maybe the external controllers were bad, so I switched them between the ""good"" blanket and the ""bad"" blanket. But that didn't seem to be the issue. My advice is this: every make and model of these types of blankets seem to have a failure rate of about 50% in my experience. The good news on these is that they are inexpensive so if you need one that works, just buy two and you are more than likely covered. Why am I not more upset that there's a 50% failure rate? There is difficulty in manufacturing a flexible yet durable high powered heater. These types of things like to be inflexible. Roof top ice melting wires also have this problem. Flexible heat tape for pipes also has this problem. Could they fix them? Sure, but not at the prices the market will accept. And in reality, even if only half the blanket works, you will still get to the temperature you need - it may just take a while.I used these for my food truck 40# tanks and they keep my tanks from icing. Nothing worse then dealing with propane issues during a busy dinner rush.Things I will say in the positive:1) It did get warm, it was not hot, I would imagine you would not a really hot blanket for a Propane tank.I will say it warms, but I had a few problems.1) I could not get the blanket tight on the tank, It just seemed too large.2) Although it got warm, it was not warm enough to keep the tank from frosting, it was 20°F so I might have been asking too much from it . The fact I could not seem to get it tight enough on the tank was probably a limiting factor, as there was small gaps between the tank and the blanket which meant I could not tighten it down well enough to actually have it make a huge impact. I am not sure if it was just my particular unit that was too large or if they all come this way.This is the ""light"" version of the Power Blanket for BBQ tanks. It works well during spring, summer and early fall but cannot manage during the cold Canadian winter (below - 10C). I use it at my summer cabin mainly to keep the tank warm and enable me to use very drop of propane in the tank. The warmed tank has better gaseous conditions for your BBQ and makes the burners of your grill burn more evenly. Will recommend this as long as you understand the limitations in cold weather and by that I mean anything below freezing accompanied by wind, or anything below -5CWe live in Quebec Canada. We have winter that uusaly goes to -20F and we have seen -35F . So since we are using only propane for heating and did not knew that below -42 the propane does not evaporate anymore . we decided to buy a Powerblanket for our 420lb tank in 2018 just to be safe. Last year (2018-2019) we had a very long and cold winter. We had a contract (2018-2019) for propane that was $130 per month for 12 month based on our 2017 usage We did have a very cold winter that did reach quite a few -30 to -36. We renew our contract in august and to our surprise the contract for 2019-2020 is now $75 per month for 12 month based on the 2018 usage. Colder winter with less usage. We did not expexted to be that good, but it isI don't know if they're all like the one I received but I had to install it on the opposite side of the heat blanket were the strap that holds it all together and now the straps are useless and name brand is directly on the propane tank so no advertising... And this way it heats the tank and not the outdoors and installed this way it works good but had to use tie raps to hold it together. Someone screwed up the assembly line...I run a food truck in Calgary, my propane tanks ""100 lbs"" freeze up when it gets below zero. I operate in the summer only and, I do a couple of event late fall, so Im hoping this will solve my problem. Only tested it so fare, first event coming up soon. will send a new review if it does not solve my problem.If you live where the temperatures plummet below zero this blanket is a must. If you own a propane fitted appliance and you’re wondering why it’s not reaching g the proper temperature well the pressure drops in the tank do to the cold. By placing the warming blanket on the propane tank has resolved my heat issues. Having said all of my findings, one of the my observations is that you need to give the blanket some time to heat up the tank before you see results.","[""Safely heats cylinder to an optimal 90 ° F / 32 °C (± 10 °F/5 °C)"",""Saves money by optimizing gas and material usage"",""Increase flow rate performance and efficiency of gas cylinders"",""Eliminate unnecessary cylinder refills in cold weather"",""Certified to UL/CSA/CE standards""]"

If you drop your phone alot. This case is perfect for you.Screen: if your looking for screen protector buy a seperate one. It has the fingerprint detector but it gets in the way and if you cant use screen with full brightness like me. (Hurts my eyes due to sinus issues) then it requires you to to see past the fingerprint things blurriness.They also provide you with the blue inner piece without a screen protector in case you prefer to use another kind of protector. This is what I have done. I also dont like a frickin blurry circle on my screen. 😂Kickstand: not easy to setup vertically. It gets stuck alot as you try to pull it out and i feel like i might break it if im not careful. I use it horizonally for videos and its better that way because i feel like i have to put more pressure and risk breaking the thing. So i never use the kickstand vertically. Always horizontal. On the bright side this is less of an issue for me because common sense i can see my videos horizontally better anyway. Kickstand is my main reason I use this case, durability is second reason.Price: a tad overpriced but online ordering it makes sense its a little high. I trust this case better than just a standard case. So its not an issue for me. Its actually a decent price for the case considering what you get. Its worth it.Ive really enjoyed this case and I give it a 5 star but it still has mild issues. not everything someone makes is perfect, so for me, through owning this considerably awesome phone case for about a month and a half,with its flaws I give it 5 stars. I have had no permanent issues and it works as intended. Kickstand works on solid surfaces, the case fits my s21plus with zero percent of potential dust/dirt entry points.Sidenote on Wireless charging: It could work with a good wireless charger. Just gotta do your homework. I have 2 different ones. one wireless charger works with 1 inch space centered in the center the other works with about 3-4 inch space in the center. meaning your wireless charger is not the problem its the case thickness. Some work without fiddling for the right position to charge some fit and can move the phone up and down without interfering with the charge. how your phone case is not the problem with overheating and wireless charging. And how it lets the heat escape (please skip reading all this jargon if this is not a problem for you):Also wireless charging can overheat your device with the case on or off this is not the cases fault. This is the phones fault. Depends on the device. Individual issues may happen and your phone might overheat more with the case on due to the heat being trapped and no exit points for dust also means the phone has little ways for heat to escape. Your phone might have air openings on the base next to charge port with android hence my s21 plus does so just trust your phone will cool down when your done with charging.",null

These work with this wedge cushion excellent.The other two chairs - one sporting a contoured foam base and another chair from another OEM sporting a tilt back seat base - non waterfall front nor rear, causes discomfort and pain in the underside of the leg at the front edge of the cushion from the seat itself.If coupled to a waterfall design, there's a really good chance that this seat cushion will work wonders for back, hip and leg relief. It worked wonders for me. I run long hours in chair non-stop now without issue whereas, with all the cushions - even auto wedges, it just didn't work at all. This cushion works for me very well.

I don't write Amazon product reviews often, but this one is very good.  In about 90 minutes including set up and clean up, I cleaned my double wall 30 foot (10 m) chimney liner.  It worked so well, that not much additional sooted creosote was coming down as I worked it back down the chimney to disassemble the rods.  On the way up, about two lunch bags of soot and creosote built up in my wood stove.  The rods are sturdy, yet flexible, and easy to handle.  The system comes with gloves, eye protector, a chuck for drill attachment, and a tool to push the spring-loaded balls to disassemble the rods (not really needed if you hae a moderately strong hand).  The stiff nylon 'tines' were barely worn after its use.  I am very pleased with this product and I saved money compared to one appointment with a chimney sweep.  This product will work best with a circular flue liner or double walled pipe, maybe not as effectively with a rectangular flue.","[""High-Quality Brush Head The bristles of the brush head are made from sturdy nylon rope, ensuring durability.

We had purchased this rug in another color (natural color) from another company and fell in love with it. We decided to purchase it in this color from Amazon for the faster shipping.The color is very pretty. The closeup shots of it are accurate. It’s a nice blend of blacks, grays, and whites.To me, it has the appearance of a natural fiber rug but is a much softer feel. In fact, with how soft it feels, I’m surprised it’s sold as indoor/outdoor. I was concerned about that; worried it would be a rough material, but it’s definitely not. I have not had to clean anything on it yet, but I’ve read reviews that spot cleaning it is easy, and with the feel of the rug’s material I can imagine that would be true.The weave on the one I received is nicely done; no pulls or irregularities. It was packaged very well and rolled out flat except for the very edge (it was lifted a bit but after a few hours, and some walking on it, it now lays flat).  This rug lays flat in all areas. The one we got from the other company is a much larger size, and I have noticed there is a little bubble in the center area. It might be due to the fact that we put furniture on it right after laying it, so it didn’t have time to flatten completely. Over time it’s flattening out though. Just something to keep in mind if you choose the larger size.We did purchase a rug pad for it. The rug itself isn’t terribly thick, but it’s not thin either. I feel with a nice rug pad it’s the perfect thickness for our needs.I have not noticed any shedding from the rug either. I saw many reviews in my search for area rugs (I don’t think any were about this rug) that complained about shedding. So far, I have not seen any of this.Another thing to note is that the edges of the rug are not PERFECTLY straight. We have vinyl plank flooring and if you’re looking at the edge of the rug against the lines in the floor, you might notice it. I’m not bothered by it, but others might be (my husband noticed it haha).

I love it. I love it despite the fact that FDM printing is not in itself a beginners hobby. Let me tell you, I went through a massive learning curve and spent some extra money on this little printer only to find out I really didn't need to have done all that. But it works. It works and happens to give me less printing problems out of my two. The other works too but so far I find my self troubleshooting that one more often than this one. Short story is I love it, I find it worth it, and I would buy it again if I wasn't interested in the newer models. I highly recommend it and I have recommended it to others who also love it. If you are brave enough to continue reading, good luck.Let me start with saying, out of the box installation isn't all that bad. At first I was a little intimidated by what I was unboxing. Only to realize much later I didn't need to be so gentle with this device. After much tinkering I eased off on how paranoid I was about breaking something. Installation was straight forward really. I didn't find myself lost, but I have some years of experience with assembling stuff. So who knows if that paid off. It was once everything was setup that I found myself questioning life. What the hell do I do now? How do I tell this machine to print anything.With a little reading I began to understand how to navigate the menu and use the MicroSD card to print models from... except I only had the models provided by the product. I was still lost on what to do outside of the sample stuff. While the printer brought some sample PLA filament, it wouldn't be enough to start my adventure with. So I quickly purchased some Creality brand name filament that seemed the same as the one provided as a sample. I then proceeded to scavenge the internet for 3D models to print. Little did I know a slicer would be needed.After finding some 3D Models online, I was faced with the realization, I can't just slap them into a MicroSD and print. That's when I discovered what a 3D Model Slicer is. After weeks of messing around with several different types of slicers I settled on the lesser advanced, and rather limited, Creality Print slicer software. Why you may ask? Because it does the job I need it to do and I have no need for all the other bells and whistles. Creality Print is tailored to their Creality Product line and I can slap on modifications to my printer and the software has presets for them already. So... yeah, simplifies my life. Anyway, point is, once I began printing models on a regular I noticed an issue began to appear.I would hear clicking and then the scratching sounds of gears slipping on the filament. At this point I had no idea of what parts really did what and how. So I had to analyze and figure out what the hell it could be. This is where I learned what an extruder is and what function it has in the 3D Printer. What I didn't know, is all the other parts yet. At that moment I was only learning what I needed to and not more beyond it. So here I am, looking at this little electric servo motor and wondering what the hell is wrong with it. It clicks, and sounds like garbage. Somehow though my prints were still finishing alright. Until it didn't, and I automatically assumed it was the extruder motor. I immediately jumped on Amazon and ordered a new one. Replacing it seemed to have fixed the issue at first. But by the second day of printing all the familiar sounds returned. Including the failed prints. So now I'm completely at a loss. Game over man.This is where I discovered the relatively cheap nature of 3D Printer parts. Each part was within $20 or less. I bought that new motor for nothing, so I'm encouraged to really dive into all the parts. I found extruder parts to swap out my OEM one for an ""Upgrade"" that ""Guarantees"" the end of clicking and slipping. Was super happy with it honestly. Though if I'm honest I didn't catch myself when I made that change. When I changed the extruder parts for the new ones I had also changed the Bowden tube as well. For those of you reading this far and have no idea what I just wrote. Neither did I until many weeks later. The point is, when I swapped out the parts and changed the tube, everything worked like new. Better than new! I was super happy, back printing nonstop... until a few weeks later it happened again. Wait a minute? Guarantee no more clicking or slipping! What the hell? Well, even worse this time around, filament was being pushed so hard into the Bowden tube that at the entry of the Bowden tube in the extruder the filament was being squished in so hard it clogged it. It would clump into a ball of filament that was really packed in and hard to remove. This happened several times before I grew so frustrated I swapped my extruder parts back to the original OEM ones. Guess what? It worked! Everything was back to normal and working. Weird. A few days later... again the extruder problem resurfaced. By this point I had grown tired. So I looked online for different types of extruders. I then stubbled upon something that lit a fire of hobbyist delight.Creality's Sprite, direct extruder. This little device is an all in one hotend and extruder combo. Nicely designed to be slapped on your neighborhood friendly Ender 3 V2. Wait. Ender 3 V2? Is this printer an Ender 3 V2? It has Ender 3 V2 in the name, does the Neo really make it that much different? Oh well, lets just purchase it and find out later. So I did, I ordered it and after a lot of trial and error found out it was not at all possible to slap on an Ender 3 V2 Neo the cool Sprite. I had gone as far as buying parts for sensors to make the Neo as close to the Ender 3 V2 version as possible. In the end it would require significant custom firmware scripting and that pushed my limited time beyond what I could afford. So... the printer went back to OEM. And the bastard started printing just fine again! What... The... Hell?! What could be causing this weird on and off working and failing?To my shame I found on Amazon Creality's Ender 3 S1 cheaper than my V2 Neo was when I bought it. Seeing as it offered everything I wanted to customize on my Neo I purchased it. No regrets! Love it too, but this is a story of the Neo. So after purchasing the S1, I kind of noticed something about the Neo I had totally ignored until that very moment. A kind of breakthrough that should have happened the very first day. The Ender 3 V2 Neo has an external extruder with a Bowden Tube that feeds into the hotend. Why does that matter? Because it means the Bowden Tube gets as hot as whatever temps you use for printing. My typical temps are in the 200C. While the tube can handle those temperature, I did print nonstop everyday for long periods of time. Hell I even preheated my printer and forgot about it for hours at some points. As it turns out, the Bowden Tube literally melts and reduces in size. Which adds friction to the filament and eventually acts as a clogged part. It wasn't until I began printing on my new S1 printer did I notice this little detail. After putting it to the test and changing the tube, printing continued without fail. Well I'll be damned! The Bowden Tube. Almost as if the Universe wanted to slap me in the face I get an email from Amazon showing me deals. What do I see? A Product specially made for my printer called, Sprite.Wait a minute?! You may be asking. Didn't I already try installing the Sprite before? Well, Creality needs to learn how naming their products is very important. The first Sprite I wrote about here is in reference to the Hotend and extruder in one package. The same one you get with the Ender 3 S1 Pro. The Sprite I am mentioning now, which is made specially for the Neo printer, is only an extruder attachment that is placed above the hotend of the Neo. What it does, is eliminates the very long Bowden tube and external extruder. While it still uses a Bowden tube it now uses a very short piece of it and in a straight line downwards, significantly reducing filament contact with the Bowden Tube. Not to mention the extruder is of higher quality with better gears and motor. I also stopped preheating my printer to increase longevity of the Bowden Tube. In short, that one, single upgrade changed the Ender 3 V2 Neo to a beast of a printer.While I admit to having made several changes I currently kept on it, the single most vital one has been the direct extruder. If I were to list a second one, it is the improved springs and leveling wheels for the bed. The original ones loosened very often and required leveling the bed manually often. Now I forget the bed can be leveled. Honestly, this printer is surprisingly good out of the box. It only got better afterwards. If you have any FDM printers with external extruders using Bowden Tubes, keep in mind the end of it goes into the hotend where temperatures will eventually damage the tube and require changing. Find good quality tubes that are highly resistant to temperatures and you'll have long printing life. I don't even suffer clogging of the nozzle. The Bowden Tube really is my only maintenance. Now I have been trying to get my S1 to match the level of reliability I get out of the Neo. While the S1 works great, I find myself having print issues I don't get on the Neo. Not to say the S1 is bad, just that I guess I haven't yet adapted to it and I'm still learning to figure out what are its best settings all around.I hope this long tale helps as I found myself making a lot of mistakes, buying parts I never needed, and missed vital clues that played major roles in productivity. This is a great printer out of the box and a good cheap test bed for learning about 3D Printing. With a little extra cash you can further reduce its maintenance and routines to spend more time printing.","[""【300°High-temp Nozzle】Upgraded brass nozzle can stand up to 300°printing temperature and it is compatible with multiple filaments such as PLA, ABS, PVA, Wood, TPU, PRTG and PA which providing more possibilities for creation."",""【Sprite Dual-Gear Direct Drive Extruder】Compatible with more filaments, Ender 3 S1 Pro 3d printer can print PLA, TPU, PETG, ABS.etc. It is more lighter and features less inertia and more precise positioning.

Nutrientrich lemongrass and cedarwood penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin granting health to the cells and fading away blemishes and marks. It makes your skin clear and vibrant. In what way are massages beneficial for the skin? Stress toys with all our lives. No exceptions. Our lifestyles are taking a toll on us thanks to all that make-up, heat styling, lack of exercise and a healthy diet and no time for oneself tends to show up on the skin eventually. With no time to relax or let the skin breathe, the beauty and shine that the skin possesses naturally is all lost. Result: Lack-luster skin with blemishes and sun tan. A regular massage with a good cream promises the flawless, impressive skin that appeals to eyes and enhances your personality. Containing the goodness of natural herbs and essential oils, this Massage Cream will gently seep in and replenish the lost nutrients and provide the skin for that dream-like sheen. A healthy pink complexion will be seen with a regular massage thereby making your skin smooth and supple. What is the benefit of Lemongrass Oil to the skin? From Cymbopogon Citratus is taken out this powerful astringent called Lemongrass. Lemongrass oil is a the perfect skin toner that goes deep in the skin's layers and regulates the sebum secretion from the sebaceous glands. Also, Lemongrass oil unclogs pores with gentle exfoliation, further cleansing the skin from within. Lemongrass Oil keeps the skin acne-free and other allergies and infections also keep off. Lemongrass oil has great anti-septic properties which make it an excellent healer. Curing scars, pigmentation, blemishes and patches is another huge benefit of having Lemongrass Oil as an active ingredient. Lemongrass oil also fights cellulite. How does Cedar wood Oil prove to be beneficial for the skin? Cedarwood Oil is an essential oil. It is extracted from the Juniperus virginiana. Cedar Wood Oil doubles as an effective acne specialist for the skin. By controlling oil, Cedarwood Oil ensures the cleansing of dirt and impurities off the skin which is attracted by oil. Cedarwood oil prevents and protects the skin from any external damage. Also, its anti-inflammatory property makes it a great shield from the UV rays of the sun. Cedar Wood oil is an excellent astringent and is effective in clearing post-acne scarring and blemishes. By promoting cell-growth and regeneration, Cedar wood Oil facilitates the skin renewal process. What is the role of Manjistha in skin care? Rubia cordifolia or Manjistha is a miracle herb for curing black spots, scars, pigmentation, irregular tanning which might lead to discoloration. Manjistha works effectively on the surface where it accelerates rapid healing and penetrates deep in skin's layers to bring back the glow and health that is robbed off due to constant exposure to harmful UVA and UVB rays. Manjistha is a healer as well as care-taker of the skin. Premature aging of the skin is significantly halted, wrinkles fade away and skin looks fresh, supple and flawless with regular use of Manjistha. What is Jojoba Oil and how does it add up as the perfect ingredient for skin care? Simmondsia chinenis or Jojoba tree yields this highly moisturizing Jojoba Oil. It is commonly called as wax ester. Jojoba tree plantations are found in North-west Mexico, South Arizona and South California. Out of all the oils found in nature, Jojoba Oil is most comparable to the oil produced by sebaceous glands of the human skin. Providing skin with high level of nutrients and moisture, Jojoba oil regulates the oil balance, removes flakiness and cures dry patches. Also, the skin feels softer, healthier and has a glow about itself. Jojoba Oil does not evaporate and hence keeps the skin hydrated round the clock. With a high percentage of anti-oxidants, Jojoba Oil envelopes the skin safe from external factors without making it greasy. What is the special moisturizing action of Almond Oil? Almond Oil is known to be the perfect remedy for dry, flaky skin as it quickly gets absorbed in the skin surface. Being a light oil, Almond Oil cures skin irritation, allergies, dry patches and makes the skin soft and supple. A great emollient, Almond Oil serves to be the perfect treatment of the skin for fighting the chill and renewing it for another season cycle. It keeps the skin's moisture balance intact. Regular massage regulates the blood circulation which in turn helps in the proper soaking of essential nutrients in the skin.

I have several C5 jackets and gloves and I will stand behind the quality and function of the C5 line and other Gore products that I have bought for decades.  But this hat is totally useless. I recommend not buying this. Its a total waste of money.  If they would have only put they're ""Gore"" wind block on this it would be superb.  Whomever is testing this thing  should be fired. Let people that actually go out and use the products test the products.  Again, this is a useless waste of $35",null

Let me share my experience with this crystal black case that has left me torn between satisfaction and frustration.First off, the case's appearance is sleek and eye-catching. The crystal black finish adds a touch of elegance to my MacBook Air, and the transparent design showcases the Apple logo beautifully. It's definitely a head-turner and has received many compliments from friends and colleagues.Installing the case was a breeze. The snap-on design ensures a secure fit, providing protection for both the top and bottom of my laptop. The precise cutouts allow for easy access to all ports and buttons, without compromising functionality.However, I encountered a minor setback when it came to heat dissipation. After extended use, I noticed that my MacBook Air tended to get warmer than usual. It seems the case doesn't allow for optimal airflow, which is disappointing considering its compatibility claims.The case offers decent protection against scratches and scuffs. My laptop has survived a few accidental bumps and drops without any damage. However, I was disappointed to discover that the case itself is prone to scratches. Within a few weeks, it started to show visible signs of wear and tear, which detracted from its overall appeal.On the bright side, the iBenzer case is lightweight, adding minimal bulk to my MacBook Air. It's easy to slip into my bag without adding unnecessary weight, which is perfect for someone always on the go.Now, let's talk about the funny mishap I experienced. Picture this: I'm in a crowded coffee shop, trying to impress a potential client with my slick MacBook Air. As I open my laptop, the case decides to pull off a magic trick and pop off the bottom shell. Talk about a show-stopper moment! Luckily, I managed to snap it back into place, but it left me red-faced and laughing.In conclusion, the iBenzer Plastic Hard Shell Case for the MacBook Air 13 Retina Display with Touch ID has its pros and cons. While it offers a stylish design, easy installation, and decent protection, it falls short in terms of heat dissipation and durability. The lightweight nature is a plus, but the case's tendency to unexpectedly detach is an amusing yet inconvenient quirk.In terms of value for money, the iBenzer Plastic Hard Shell Case offers an affordable option compared to some of the higher-end MacBook cases on the market. While it may not have the same level of durability or premium features, it does get the job done for everyday use.One thing I appreciated about the case is its ease of cleaning. The plastic material makes it simple to wipe off any smudges or fingerprints that accumulate over time. This is particularly useful for individuals who like to keep their MacBook Air looking pristine.However, it's worth noting that the crystal black color may show scratches more easily compared to other color options. So, if you're someone who wants to maintain a flawless appearance, you might want to consider a different color or a different material altogether.Another aspect to consider is the availability of customer support. iBenzer has a reputation for responsive customer service, which is always a plus. If you encounter any issues or have questions about the product, you can expect prompt assistance.Considering all these aspects, I rate the iBenzer case 3 out of 5 stars. It's a decent option for those seeking a visually appealing case with moderate protection, but be prepared for some drawbacks along the way.","[""⚠️【Check your Model】 - ONLY for MacBook Air 13 inch Case 2022 2021 2020 2019 2018 Release with Touch ID (Models: M1 A2337 A2179 A1932) MVFH2LL/A, MVFM2LL/A, MVFK2LL/A, MVFJ2LL/A, MVFN2LL/A, MVFL2LL/A, MREE2LL/A, MREC2LL/A, MRE82LL/A, MREA2LL/A, MREF2LL/A, MRE92LL/A"",""❌【Not Fit】 - This case is NOT compatible with 2022 M2 MacBook Air 13 Inch (The latest Model: A2681) and Older MacBook Air 13 Released BEFORE 2018 (Models: A1466/A1369).

No frays or breaks yet with twice weekly use. Wear eye protection eventually they all likely break.Excellent tubing for the right job. You must know what the application you are plan to use the tubing for. Because this can be too strong for the job. My was job was for work out equipment , the tubing increase resistance buy 50% .

You'll lose them!"" Only to find out that she received a new copy back in '97 when I was 5 is absolutely infuriating! She kept them in a hap-hazard manila folder and they have aged poorly. Well, rather than deal with bureaucratic nightmare, I'm safeguarding these in these protectors. Make sure you can get a job and safeguard your documents too!These insert sleeves are not as clear as claimed. They have some haziness in the plastic. But they are the best top-loaders (without pre-punched holes) that I could find. They worked well for my application, which was housing archival letters. I think they would also work well for housing archival photos, but scan the pictures before putting them in these sleeves.Delivery was prompt.I like the quality of the item.I tried to find the legal size locally, but did not. It was very important for me to have this size for an historical document to prevent folding and tearing of the paper.Really great for saving useful docsI bought these hoping they would be large enough to replace the ""glassines"" I used when working; however, they don't allow a very thick stack of papers. They really are meant for only a couple of sheets. I can still use them so I won't be returning them, but they just weren't what I had hoped.It was EXACTLY what I was looking, arrived promptly & just in time for purposes intended.Product exactly as advertised. Used to protect paperwork handled 5 days a week. Have ordered other sheet protectors in the past, these are my favorites hands down. Heavier and more durable than expected. Will order again.I have come to realize that documents of significant value should be protected, else they will become badly worn and/or damaged after some years. Since lamination prevents the document from being authenticated, putting it in a plastic sleeve becomes a proper choice.I'm quite happy with this C-Line product after I received it. The sleeve feels quite sturdy and substantial. The edge is bound by thermal and punctuation. I hope the protect they provide do last for years.It's not as nice as the sheet protectors from Business Source, but they are no longer for sale. Out of the no-hole heavy duty sheet protectors I could find on amazon, these are the best. I might stock up on those because they run out.... if it didn't have about an inch of text at the lower right - I mean, I get it, it's their name. I just thought it was actually clear like those pockets you get in binders - or maybe a one-liner of text, not too depressed on the plastic. Don't get me wrong, it IS quality product, it just didn't work out for me.Although the sheet protectors has all of the characteristics that I was looking into, it is not as strong, thick as I would have liked.These are ok - top loading - no holes - not very thick but will give good protection to your page - HOWEVER they are not the full height of A4 paper so if you use A4 you will have to cut off 2cm of the paper to make them fit.

Thank you for posting them! This watch looks high end, for under $40. We'll see how it holds up. The only thing, it's a little big, but I'm going to take it to a local jeweler for $20 to have a link or two removed. I don't mind it not sitting snug on my wrist, but this drapes on my hand, so ...but overall, a great watch for the price!Very nice watch. If it didn't have the little crystals at the hours it could almost pass for a Rolex, ha ha.I did have to have 4 links removed but then I have a small wrist. Very attractive watch.There was no way to adjust the watch to my smaller size. Therefore, I gave it to my daughter, whom it fit perfectly. It's very elegant looking, giftable, and also water resistant.Buen tamaño, para personas que tenemos muñeca chiquita, me encanto!!✅Tamaño✅Calidad✅PrecioThis watch is absolutely adorable, presentable e chic.

Haven't try the water resistant, definitely not taking shower w/itI am in love with it 🥰 happy birthday to meI have a very small wrist (about 13-14inch) and also it’s a small watch face, it still looks good on my wrist.. The pins on this one was very easy to remove. It is a nice Rolex dupe! I don’t know about it being water resistant, but because it’s a cheap watch just remove it.It will work, but I expected more from this.El envio:-Llego muy rápido y sin ningún problema.-Llego bien empacado.El producto:-Esta muy hermoso el reloj para el precio que se adqurio.- Ya había adquirido relojes de esta marca pero por el motivo que doy 3 estrellas es porque me dejo que desear, las correas se sienten de un material barato pero con un acabado hermoso, la esfera no parece ser de vidrio si no de plástico y tiene un relieve por su tipo de acabado. El fondo es perlado, las manecillas brillan y tiene 11 cristales swarovski que le dan un toque elegante.-Fuera de todo es un reloj hermoso.The watch felt very thin and flimsy which made the watch feel cheap. Not what I expected for the relatively high price of $50 something dollars. I’ve bought many other watches off amazon for that price and been amazingly surprised by the quality. I returned the watch.The watch looked just like the picture, no disappointment there. It worked great when I set the time and is still keeping good time. It looks nice, feels nice on the wrist and is very affordable.Great watch well worth the price.El reloj es lindo pero pensé que sería un poco más grande, es un mini reloj pulsera nada espectacular.Love this!

My 11 month old is learning to walk - he can walk very well assisted, and is so close to taking his first steps by himself - so I wanted to find a shoe to help support his walking, and also a shoe that he can't take off by himself!  He's been able to take off all crib shoes and socks with the exception of a bootie that fastens with a snap around his ankle so I knew I had to find a boot that could fasten around his ankle.  I saw these and read the reviews and had to get them - especially since I love their retro look and knew they would be perfect for his fall first birthday photos outdoors.The only issue (I see so far) is that the size chart is not correct.  I measured his foot to make sure to get the right size and his foot measures about 4 3/4"" so after reading the size chart, I decided to get the size 5 1/2 shoe which the measurement chart states would be for a 5"" foot.  The shoes I received are almost an inch bigger than that from back of heel to tip of toe (not including the sole since it has an extra lip around the edge of the shoe)...so I have to return/exchange for a smaller size as they're far too big and look like clown shoes on my guy!!",null

Skechers for Work Men's Hartan Steel Toe Slip-On Shoe,Skechers,Work Shoes,"[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Men"",""Shoes"",""Loafers & Slip-Ons""]",Skechers,Mens,"After I started overnights at a warehouse job in '21, I quickly found myself aching by the end of each shift and in need of a new shoe that would offer proper support for 8 hours of freight hauling across concrete floors. At that time, I found this slip-on offering by Skechers at a local retailer.These met all my sizing and comfort requirements, provided good traction, and offered a steel toe that I often forcefully and inadvertently banged into palettes with no consequence; that steel toe also gave me the ability to easily handle heavy boxes by wedging my shoe underneath a bottom edge to give myself 3 points of contact for lifting. These shoes did just the trick I needed, and lasted me the duration of the job, though were showing signs of wear by the end (about 4 months).A year or so later, and pleased by my prior experience, I decided to get a new pair to aid my job prospects, and to my chagrin, could not find any at local retailers, including a dedicated Skechers outlet. A search on the Skechers website at the time also turned up empty.I wound up finding the exact same model here on amazon, and ordered another pair a half-size down to accommodate some lost weight as well as more casual wear, as I had chosen a deliberately oversized pair before in order to allow room for two pairs of socks (and thus, extra cushion). As the oversized pair had worn out, the amount of slack in them had gotten to be problematic even with extra socks on, giving uncertain purchase on the floor and developing a proclivity for ankle rolling.This new pair was more snug, though definitely not uncomfortably so, and offered better stability, but began to wear out faster than the ones I owned prior. Within probably two months, the stitching around the exterior of the toe cap began to rip out, making them much less useful during a round of job interviews I had coming up, and which had not happened to the older pair even after being used on the job and later beat up at home doing yard work. Like the old pair, these new ones also demonstrated a tendency to roll the ankle, as I found using them outside in uneven terrain.I suspect these issues I encountered contributed to their scarcity at the retailers in town, and I will not likely be getting another pair of them for the cost and low lifespan unfortunately. While they do offer a good deal of convenience and job-site versatility for a slip-on shoe, I think the slip-on design's elasticity and lack of ankle support works against other features of the design, such as the high-traction tread and front-heaviness of the steel toe; while lighter than a typical boot, these shoes tend to put their weight on the top of your foot instead of anchoring to the leg, which can sometimes start to wear on the ligaments after a long fatigued day.To summarize, you'll get a lot of comfort out of these shoes for the first couple months probably, but they'll be in line for replacement soon after, and won't be able to substitute for a full-on steel-toed boot or even lace-up shoe in terms of ruggedness and stability.",null

I wasn't sure about the quality and effectiveness. They are 24"" total diameter. That is pretty small for ceiling fans. However, I have a relatively small screen room porch and I thought normal 36-52"" fans would  be too much.Well, not only do these look good and fit the size scale, they are very effective! These are not typical ceiling fans with the heavy AC motors. I had also purchased the typical ceiling fan mount adapters for the light outlets separately, thinking I needed them. However, these fans are very light weight and I believe use DC stepper motors. This means that mounting them meant just screwing the base plate to the ceiling.This design means that when the fan is turned on, it quickly ramps to speed. When shut off, it ramps down to a stop very fast as well. It is very quiet as well. when at speed, you only hear the air moving!The fan also has nice LED lighting with 3 color temperature modes selectable from the remote. This leads me to my only complaint.The remote is designed to be able to operate multiple fans which is important to me as I have two installed. It does work once setup but I do notice that if I press buttons too quickly in succession, the fans can become out of sync. I usually only see this in the lighting color. You need to wait 1-2 seconds between button presses on the remote to prevent the two fans from having different color lights, or fan speeds if changing them. When this happens, I have found that rapid button presses to continue the change will make it eventually come back around to being in sync, but is it a bit of a pain.Other than that, these have been great!

A fabulous alternative where space is limited or tight, making them friendly for the whole family. With different shades and natural designs, otherwise known as veining, no two sinks will be alike. Also for your convenience, anti-slip rubber pads are included with the brass legs to ensure steadiness. Water supply kit, drain assembly, and the faucet are sold separately. Kingston's carrara marble tops are polished, but they are not sealed. Polished marble has a shiny surface and resists stains.

The following is intended solely for informational purposes. Kingston does not warranty nor accept liability for damages or other negative outcomes resulting from any treatment or coating applied to the countertop after purchase, whether applied by the customer or by a third party. For anyone unfamiliar with this nature of project, Kingston recommends consulting an experienced professional in your area.

It gave a very nice deep pink color saturated nicely. The downside is that it makes a huge mess everywhere. It also stains every single thing it touches and it is impossible not to get it somewhere on some thing. We ended up having to go out side for the application process because it was so messy. Even being as careful as you possibly can you will inevitably drip some-touch some thing- rub up against some thing -somehow the stuff travels. I’ll say it’s a good product it works, invest in a plastic cape maybe two one for yourself and one for whoever’s hair you’re putting it in some really good gloves some good ventilation make sure you dye the hair to lighter shade of blonde As you can get and pile my stuff on leave it on forever and prepare to scrub your shower down when you get out.I bought red and blue and did half and half on my stepsons hair. It turned out SOO cool!! Very vibrant, bright colors that last a long time! He gets so many compliments on his hair out in public. I highly recommend this product!!VIBRANT blue, sets in quickly to bleached hair! Love this color.Very easy to make touch-ups by hand with gloves on, as it's viscous enough to manipulate easily like finger-painting.I've used manic panic for a long time. The thing about the brand is that it's not permanent. But It's one of the better semi-permanent hair dyes out there that's not too expensive.Red colors will stick MUCH better than blue colors. Which is why when hair dye fades your hair becomes brassy (or even green yikes!). The red, yellow, and orange in the dyes linger the longest.The fade on this is pretty good. I recommend mixing it with manic panic's silver blue to help the fade be less brassy. Your fade will be more silver and less green that way.ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAIR IS FRESHLY WASHED AND NOT GREASY OR CONTAINING CHEMICALS BEFORE APPLYING THIS KIND OF DYE. I didn't wash my hair after swimming in a pool once and the leftover chlorine in my hair made the color wash out completely. Your hair needs to be clean and it needs to be dry. No grease, no hairspray, no nothing. Wash your hair in the morning, let it dry, and then add the dye in the evening.IF YOU DON'T BLEACH YOUR HAIR, THE DYE WILL NOT STICK AS WELL. Even if you bleach your hair for just 10 or 15 minutes it makes the color stick better than putting it on your natural hair. If you have a strict no-bleach policy then I hope you at least have blonde hair. Because the color will look really gross otherwise. Brown just doesn't mix with vivid colors like this. Brown makes everything else brown.LEAVE THE DYE IN YOUR HAIR FOR LONGER THAN THE RECOMMENDED TIME. I put a shower cap on and sleep in it, or leave it in for 6 hours. Some people will say it doesn't matter as long as it's over an hour. I think it matters. Leave the dye in for at least 3 hours.RINSE YOUR HAIR WITH COLD WATER AND DO NOT WASH WITH SOAP. DO NOT WASH WITH SOAP!!!! When it comes time to rinse out this dye, if you use shampoo after applying it you will notice an immediate fade. If you just rinse your hair with COLD water until the color in the water fades to pretty much clear, then you will have washed all the dye residue off. Not washing your hair for at least 48 hours after the initial rinse will help bind the color to your hair and make it fade slower. Don't skip this step. Seriously. Don't use shampoo or conditioner for 48 hours after rinsing this dye out with cold water.SPRAY IN SHAMPOO IS YOUR FRIEND.For anyone coloring their hair using semi-permanent dye, it's going to fade. And it's going to fade in proportion to how much you wash your hair. Wash your colored hair in COLD or COOL water always. Tie it up and don't get it wet if you like hot showers. Turn the shower water cold or wash it in the sink. I only wash my hair once a week. I've trained my hair and now it only starts to get oily after about the 5th day of not washing it. Your color will stay vivid and you will need to buy less hair dye if you wash your hair less. Washing your hair every day is damaging to your scalp and hair anyway.MIX THIS DYE WITH A RED DYE TO GET A LONGER LASTING DARK PURPLE. For some reason purple hair dye doesn't stick to save your life. I've tried every type of manic panic purple and it's gone after the third wash. Mix midnight blue with vampire red to get a lovely purple color. You can add developer or your choice of conditioner to the mix in order to make the colors lighter. Red to blue ratio decides if the purple is more navy purple, plum, or magenta.FOLLOW THESE RULES AND YOUR COLOR WILL LAST YOU A MAXIMUM OF 5-6 WEEKS BEFORE YOU HAVE TO REAPPLY OR TOUCH UP YOUR ROOTS.Okay I’m writing this while my hair is still drying.. however I wanted a ombré type style because I wanted to do something that I had never done before. I have dark brown hair so I ordered manic panic bleach (which did a good job) and then siren dye. I used the entire container on my head and left it on for 90 minutes. After the 90, I rinsed it out with cold water (like the reviews suggested). As I’m looking at my hair, I notice that most of the color was rinsed out too. My hair is sadly not at all as vibrant and lovely like the other reviews :( I definitely will be trying a different color because it looks more like I had color that faded over a long period of time . I am NOT blaming the color or brand , as maybe it just doesn’t take to hair like mine. I will be trying a darker blue to see if that does a better job. Second time is a charm hopefully :)Before this my hair was all pink, orange and blonde, all faded. Didn’t want to dye my hair since I’m pregnant. So I did most of my hair with this blue and my undercut purple. The blue took but not to my dirty blonde roots. Definitely worth it! Oh and it also hasn’t faded too too much and it’s been a month. I hope that helps you all!Had a vibrant color and has lasted several shampoo sessions. Application was easy and the color smells good.Used it to make myself ginger spice mix with arctic foxs sunset orange and a purple. Totally recommend if you need a vibrant yellowHa preso perfino sulle parti più scure quando ho decolorato creando una bellissima sfumatura, è molto resistente per essere un pigmento e attualmente ho questo colore dal 20 gennaio ed ha schiarito solo sulle punte. Consiglio di applicare con dei guanti e proteggere la pelle con della vaselina perché macchia tantissimo e quando ci si lava di fare attenzione a non schizzare ovunque perché le macchie rimangono per un pochino 😂 Inoltre lo consiglio anche a chi è castano chiaro o biondo scuro per avere dei bellissimi riflessi rosa/magenta 👍🏻💕I would’ve liked to give 5* but this did not live up to expectations. I’ve used manic panic purple haze before (even that had its drawbacks) and loved the pigmentation of that color. This one was left on for almost an hour. After checking the strands, I noticed it wasn’t taking (that’s why some strands are lighter in the pic provided) and I Had to reapply and used heat (how I was able to achieve that really nice vibrant green). If you want that vibrant green, you’ll have to go against instructions to achieve so definitely not for a first time user or someone unfamiliar with coloring imo.If your hair is light brown and you don't want to bleach it - it's the right colour for you. Rather than being the colour presented by the seller, which you're only gonna achieve with bleached hair, it gives you this nice (imho tasteful) denim blue, depending on the undertones in your hair. It might be that the warmer the undertones, the more green hue you're gonna get as it washes out - my hair has rather cold undertones. I left the dye on for just over 2 hours, as the strand test showed half an hour is just not enough. It didn't damage my hair at all. HOWEVER please don't skip the part where it tells you to protect your hairline and neck with petroleum jelly (or sudocrem in my case) and wear gloves, because it stains A LOT, and within SECONDS, and you don't want to look like Papa Smurf, do you? I also wore a plastic bag over my shoulders for the initial rinse, to protect my arms from being blue, as I'm quite pale. When it comes to staining the bathroom, I found using a regular shower cleaner removed it very easily.Non so come sia da solo, io l’ho usato mixato con Psychedelic Sunset in parti uguali, l’arancione più bello che abbia mai fatto! E ne ho fatti tanti! 😁 foto senza filtri!!Penso sia utile lasciare questa recensione perché ho notato parecchia incertezza e confusione al riguardo. È la seconda volta che compro questo prodotto e ve lo consiglio assolutamente! Non fatevi spaventare dalle dimensioni del barattolo perché vi assicuro che vi dura un sacco!Come? Ora ve lo spiego.Dopo vari tentativi e ricerche ho capito come usare questa tinta al meglio. Vi basterà infatti mettere in una ciotola 1/3 di tinta e 2/3 di balsamo. L'intensità e la durata è la stessa ma non vi macchierà i vestiti. Vi suggerisco di lavarvi i capelli, dopo aver lasciato in posa il prodotto, con i guanti così da evitare qualsiasi macchia sulle mani. Per quanto riguarda la doccia o la vasca, io avendo una doccia vecchia so bene che un po di colore può rimanere ma dopo un po va via senza problemi. Questo prodotto vi lascerà i capelli morbidissimi e profumati, è adatto anche a chi ha la cute più sensibile e credo che sia una valida alternativa ai prodotti del supermercato.Spero che la mia recensione vi sia stata utile!","[""After Midnight Hair Dye Color; This Blue Shade Of Hair Dye Color For Light Or Dark Hair Is The Deepest Darkest Navy Blue Reminiscent Of A Clear Night Sky; This Color May Add Slight Dark Blue Highlights To Unbleached Hair"",""Mixable Colors And Tones; All MANIC PANIC Hair Colors Are Safe To Mix To Create Custom Shades Making The Possibilities Of Shades Endless; Combine Any Formula With The Pastelizer To Create Soft On Trend Pastel Hues; Ready To Use; No Developer Required"",""Semi Permanent Hair Dye; This Semi Permanent Hair Dye Formula Gradually Fades In Four To Six Weeks Because It Does Not Penetrate The Cortex Of Your Hair But Simply Rests On Top Of The Hair Shaft"",""Cruelty Free And Vegan Formula; This Color Cream Hair Dye Features Vegan Ingredients Tested On Celebrities Not Animals; Made In The USA; Hair Color Is PPD And Ammonia Free; Paraben Free; Gluten Free; Resorcinol Free; Phthalate Free; PETA Accredited"",""For Best Results; Vibrant Color Results Are Best Achieved By Applying To Hair That Has Been Prelightened With MANIC PANIC Flash Lightning Bleach Kits; Bleaching Thoroughly To A Level Nine Or Ten Before Dyeing Is Recommended For The Best Results""]"

ThanksThis product did exactly what I needed it to do, which basically saved us tons of money! Our dark maroon couch is over 15 years old, and parts of its leather cushions looked more white than maroon due to age, too much sunshine, and just plain old wear and tear. A few weeks ago, I purchased FurnitureClinic Leather Re-Coloring Balm, which did a beautiful job of restoring the color. Only problem was, the color kept rubbing off after it dried. So, I threw a goofy piece of fabric over the cushions until I could figure out the next step. Fiebing's Acrylic Resolene was my product of last resort. It goes on very shiny, then settles in as it dries. And once it dries, IT PASSES THE WIPE TEST! Color is locked in, and our butts are safe. Thank you, Fiebing's!seals leather easy to use, nice shine without being too glossyFlexible and durable. Plays well with gel and paste antique.Easy 5 stars -- does exactly what it advertises. I'm thrilled.Restored our favorite recliner that Leather had faded where we put our head..........PERFECT! Like a new chair and saved us price of a new one at today's sky hi prices..........thank Feibling......Dye worked well alsoEasy restore. Took a little time as it needs to dry between a few min for each thing.......but its well worth it.I liked that it was easy to use . A bit darker than I expected for saddle I was thinking more of a tan look . Dried well .Clean finishSpot on works great. I kept an old bottle and diluted it 50/50 with water so I now have 2 bottles of the stuff. Using it neat from the bottle can make the leather too shiny, better to build up the layers to your own requirements.Not sure if its the current heat, or what, but wouldn't use these products again, probably even considering the paints over dyes then sealing which I didn't like idea of as I thought they would be poorer wear.Despite multiple coats of resolene over the dye and left for a day still seems tacky and can directly transfer dye directly onto your hand/arm/elsewhere ( was hand brushed thinly not lumped down).Isn't this meant to be a finish that stops that?If anything just seemed to re-wet the dye and pushed the dye around the sofa??I preferred idea of dye then seal and wanted to use as learning opporunity.The oxblood dye a little messy but worked, expected that to be messy ( tried to prep all the sofa first with acetone to prep)The dye taken seemingly okHowever the resolene doesn't seem to be working at all ( perhaps I need more, but the pots sold, are very small and nothing to suggest the small pot isn't enough)Would have prefered to try airbrush but didnt have to hand so followed advice toEach brush of the product onto the work, despite being applied dry, seems to be picking up dye, rather than laying down finish?Did not work well with hand application, despite saying could apply on? Each brush is actually pickup up dye onto the applicator, so perhaps all its doing is spreading the dye aroundNot sure if this is specific to the oxblood dyeAs a result Its still bleeding really bad has been a bit of a nightmare and left not wanting to use Fiebling for DIY again, perhaps better for experienced leatherworkers.Going to now look for another finish product that perhaps can be sprayed onThis seals leather so the dye doesn't rub off on clothes. Did the job but does need quite a few applications.I was recommended this product and they were right although the product was and is great delivery time also great but the driver extremely poorToo early to judge if it'll last but changed shoe colour from dark brown to black.

However, this might just be my favorite! I love how roomy it is and all the great pockets like any Kipling but I love that it stands up by itself!! In fact, I've ordered another color and am only bummed it takes so long to get to the US from England (I believe this is a European only style). It's similar in size and organization to a Erica (or formally a Europa). Get this one it's well worth it.I love Kipling. I still miss my first one that was stolen about a month ago. I could not find that one to replace it anywhere so I guess it’s been discontinued. This one is smaller and I’m getting used to it. It’s supposed to be dark green but nobody can really tell. Sometimes it looks blue, sometimes gray, it’s weird but I like it.The description is very misleading the dimensions of the bag are taken from the outside. The last picture which shows the bag compared to a mannequin is very inaccurate. The inside has many small corners that make it hard to fit bigger items my small umbrella can’t fit standing up. The bag is good enough for small items and flexible items. I was planning on using it for college, as you can see in the picture above I am able to fit my laptop ( without the sleeve or with a very slim sleeve) and about two or three notebooks. I can also fit a pencil case and a makeup case, my wallet, and several other things. The side pockets can barely fit my phone. Even though the bag isn’t what I expected I still like it. The pattern is very pretty and the bag is lightweight, even after putting everything I need inside it I can comfortably carry it aroundI love my bag and thank you for shipping it to me alot sooner than expected🤗Love these medium-large crossbody bags (with no extraneous shoulder straps). The emerald green is very dark green (almost looks green-blue-black); very nice subdued color.Thank you for prompt delivery! The bag is awesome, just as described. Very happy with this seller!TodoNice product for my wifeLovely bag but most of the zips are the wrong way round for me, unlike my other “gabbie”. I always carry my bag over my right shoulder with the large exterior pockets to the outside and prefer zips to be close to my hand. On this bag the zips open from “back” to “front”! It’s not a big issue but it just feels wrong. If I rest my hand on the bag, the zip opening is at the other end & feels slightly less secure. Having said that, the “gabbie” is a perfect size that holds all my essentials with room for a few extra bits and pieces. This bag is a lovely colour with an attractive strap. Highly recommended :-)Long standing Kipling fan. This is a perfect size with useful compartments. An excellent neutral colour and lightweight. It can be worn as a shoulder bag or crossbody. Strong zips . Beware there are two Gabbie bags - shoulder and crossbody. The crossbody one is much smaller so check the dimensions to get the size you want,I love Kipling bags. I got this to replace my old Kipling bag because after 9 years it’s starting too look a bit ratty. I saw this one on sale and decided to buy it. I got the blue denim colour one and it’s really nice and very roomy. It’s smaller than my last bag but it has plenty of pockets and a good central space. The strap is adjustable and can be worn over the shoulder or as a crossbody style bag. Like all Kipling bags it’s super lightweight.I needed a fairly large bag to carry a variety of essential items. It is such a strong and durable bag. I wanted a neutral 'denim' colour, so this is perfect. It has lots of pockets and I prefer the metal monkey. The only thing that is missing in these new style Kipling bags if the key fob... which some people may miss! I would highly recommend item and price on this site.Brilliant bag , good size , lots of zipped pockets / organisation . I have this bag in black , these are well made , strong and showerproof bags . They are expensive , but for me they are worth paying the extra money . I have muscle and joint problems and Kipling bags are light before you start to pack them . The strap is really strong and is wide enough not to cut into your shoulder , it extends to a really long length . I would recommend this bag if you are looking for a bigger size day to day bag to take to work etc .",[]

"Westin 27-6125 Black Aluminum Step Boards for Trucks and SUV's 72""",Westin,"Westin's Sure-Grip Black Aluminum Running Boards are made of aluminum with a black powdercoat finish, topped with a super high-grip rubberized step pad and finished with molded polymer end caps. The running board has a length of 72"". An extremely bright light kit can be purchased separately to increase step visibility in low-light situations. The board is 4-1/2"" wide for secure footing. They provide easier entrance into the passenger area. It requires a vehicle-specific mount kit. Mount Kit Part No 27-1835 sold seperately.","[""Automotive"",""Exterior Accessories"",""Running Boards & Steps"",""Running Boards""]",‎Westin,,"Westin is one of those companies that likes to sell products for the money. . . but does not stand behind them.I installed a set of these boards with Westin 27-1835 Mounting Kit on my 2010 Acadia and admit they look good, HOWEVER there are some issues. The mount kit only has two brackets per side, and the 72 inch boards flex when I step on them (200 lbs). The passenger side fits up nice and the splash trim also, but the drivers side is something else. the splash trim does not fit up correctly to the rocker causing a gap and it rattles.I found a phone number for Westin and called them. Well after going over it I was ask to put it into an e-mail (written) so they could work on it. After being gone on vacation for 2 weeks I seen no messages from them so contacted them again (30 day return running out) I was requested to send pictures of mounting and boards, so I did and after a week with no confirmation of receiving information or pictures I contacted them again. NOW return period has expired. I was told they (customer service) received the materials and sent it to the Engineering department. They (Westin Engineering) would contact me with a resolution or correction for this problem. That was in May and it is now September and have heard or seen nothing from Westin.The little woman is only 4'-10"" and 70 years young with spinal stenosis and the Acadia sits fairly high up with the 19"" wheels so running boards are a necessity. I not only have the expense of the mounting kit and boards, but I had a shop install them so I am invested about five bills into this. Now in northern Michigan winter is just around the corner and with the splash trim not fitting up properly who knows how much slop and ice will be on the step area or collecting up under the rocker to rot it out from the salt.Westin is one of those manufacturers that likes your money but could care less about their products problems. I would recommend buying from someone else unless you care less about bad products or have money to burn for new ones. This all started the first part of May, and my last contact to Westin ( as they have yet to contact me once though said they would) was the end of May and they (engineering) were going to contact me. . . Now it's September and nothing yet. RECOMMEND AVOIDING WESTIN PRODUCTSReceived item and went to install on my 2012 GMC Acadia. I read instructions about 5 times and still had trouble understanding them. I downloaded better instructions from Westin website. Matched all nuts and bolts except two weather strips. They were not listed on the parts summary. They were not listed on instructions. Where did they go on my vehicle?? Played with several scenarios but nothing matched. Searched website for over three hours to find help and finally the instructions I needed. Turn step boards on top, locate tiny groove on vehicle side, remove one endcap. Unscrew one side screw and two tiny backside screws located close to end of step board. Slide weather strip inside small grove. It will slide easy and take the entire weather strip, no trimming needed. Turn step board back over and mount to truck.The four black steel mounting brackets needed to be lettered or itemized. The bracket with the large dip or cut out in it goes on pasenger rear. Have someone help you with these brackets. It is difficult to hold bracket, and try to thread a flat washer, lock washer and nut over bolt while holding a steel bracket. My wife was an unwilling volunteer but when she finally ran out of cuss words, I had my helper.End results, the running boards look great. I took me about 2 hours total time. You will save about 50% over what a car dealer will charge you. Amazon had the best prices and very fast delivery.These look great on our grey SUV and were fairly easy to put on - for two people. Now I knew that from researching online and that a mounting kit was needed (purchased separately). The biggest 'get' from these is my 4 year old can finally get in the car without getting on her knees on the car floor to get in or sitting down on the floor to get out. The harder part for adults (and the reason for 4 of 5 stars, although not the product's fault, per se) is to get used to getting out and stepping further away from the car as these hit you in the calf area. So for taller people it will just take some getting used to - for shorter ones the added step may help. So again, that is not a fault of the product but it;s the only feature keeping me from 5 stars. There is good/bad to getting running boards and that feature is not enought to outweigh the benefit for the kids and, to be honest, they look really good on the vehicle for FAR less than the Toyota OEM running boards.I got these running boards along with the required brackets from Westin for my 2012 Traverse. Installation was easy although the direction could've been made simpler. Overall it only took me a hour or so and all I needed was a socket wrench and a mat to cover the garage floor since I don't have a lift. It looks really nice and now my wife and son can actually get into the truck without needing climbing gear. The rubberized step is great for when it rains. There is a tiny bit of flex when I put my full 200lb frame on it but in reality I'll probably not be using it, only the family. I recommend it.I added these running boards to my Jeep to help my elderly parents get in and out of the vehicle. It is working. I took it to the dealer for installation and the technician gave me the thumbs up for choosing Westin.Bought for a GMC Acadia. Had some on my previous vehicle and tried finding similar ones in black instead of chrome. Only ones I could find. Only thing is chrome ones reached all the way to the splash guard, these don't. Wish they were about 2 inches longer.great product, easy install, looks great. I installed these running boards on my 2017 4runner limited with 27-1945 mount kit. took about 45 mins with hand tools.","[""Comes with an aluminum baseboard with a black powdercoat finish"",""Provided with a super high-grip rubberized step pad"",""Secure footing due to 4-1/2\"" wide board"",""Helps easy entry into the passenger area"",""Mount Kit sold seperately""]"

The construction is perfect! Not a stitch nor strand out of place. This is my new favorite Florida shirt,  as the Covid plague will not allow me to escape to any one of my other residences. This shirt is not flimsy, as one might assume for the price.  It is great relaxing summer wear.  The shirt is slightly billowy, and the neckline is at the crest of the shoulders.This is perfect, as our body heat is able to escape without leaving a sweat line.  I collect clothing from around the world, as I must own every creation from the US, and Europe.  I have been collecting Asian designs for a decade now, and have a tailor in Hong Kong, Bali, and neighboring Java, for their wonderful block printed tie dye shirts. Which are available on Amazon.  TO DIE FOR!Back to Africa, on subject; For $16, I would pay double. These shirts are beautifully vivid, and fortunately I have a dark tan, as they really highlight a dark African skin tone. That said, many color choices would suit every skin color.  Athough I am on the thin side,  I have wide shoulders and there are no shoulder lines. At 6'4, and 195lbs, I believe 30 extra pounds could fit into the same XL size.  It is a very forgiving shirt.  Way back in the 60's, when we all remember seeing the moon landing,  I recall seeing guys with long hair wearing these. I was jealous, as my mother would never allow me to have long hair , but then again, I would look like Art Garfunkel...I am back, great shirts that I will collect. For the exceptional quality, and ridiculously inexpensive price,  I will order many more.  I may even order a shark necklace,  as they are not endangered.  Very cool, and very cool looking.  Even if I am only a white man.Update 2021Shirts are great, and really hold up to washing.  I do not remember if I noted that I never machine dry any clothes , that I can think of.  Strangely this year I did not spend time laying out for a tan. I guess this is because my housekeeper and husband who I trusted implicitly for 7 years took off with the $70k for my tropical pool. It was only a portion of the theft,but I was traumatized by the heartless betrayal of a couple I trusted as the family I no longer have living.  I should have a book filled with every criminal worker who has found a way to burn me while looking me honestly in the eyes, and lied with utmost sincerity.  As I inherited a half dozen homes in and out of the country,  there is nothing comparable to the scammers  in FL.At any rate, I do not look great in the yellow shirt without the tan. Born at our summer home in Bar Harbor, Maine, I really enjoyed escaping to add some flavor to my lily white nature.  When very young I asked my mother why non-WASP people were called colored? Being ignorant I said "" but we are the people who change colors"". I was always jealous of Latin or Mediterranean skin tones. Where others saw prejudice, I felt jealous of beauty. This year when I put on the bright yellow/blue and green shirt, I looked even more washed out.  So maybe in a week I will try it on again.  In my mid sixties, I have been lucky to not look old and a dried up prune. But lily white does not look good with bright yellow.  It just makes me look awkward.  I have spent my life traveling the world, and collecting the most beautiful handmade items, and sometimes items just make you look goofy. These shirts are great! But until my color is just right I will be wearing my ankle length jedi hooded kaftans, that I have in almost every color. In cotton and linen they are super comfortable, and I can layout the building of my tropical pool and bridge. I have finally stopped beating myself up over, and like an old dog, I have learned a lesson.  As Covid kept us prisoners in one home, I would never go out back and stare at my stupidity. I laid out for some sun and noticed the shirt would look great soon. These shirts are great fun, and attract a lot of positive attention,  even for a white man.  They bring back all the beautiful memories of Africa. Such a beautiful continent, filled with more smiles than anywhere I had ever been.","[""100% Cotton"",""Pull On closure"",""Hand Wash Only"",""QUALITY DESIGN - Traditional bohemian dashiki tunic tops with 2 large front pockets.

The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is the color is a little different than pictured (but it works for me, so I'll keep it) and also the ""belt"" could be tied on the side like a wrap dress but the way the belt is attached, you end up with one long piece hanging down and a substantially shorter short piece.

Period","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Women"",""Clothing"",""Jeans""]",WallFlower,Womens,"3.5 stars rounded upIf I wasn’t so tall, these would probably be 5 stars.I ordered the Albury and the Betsy. I was hesitant to get these because at 6’2, I usually get my jeans in 35-37” inseam, especially because the majority of my height is my legs. Plus, I’m curvy, so my butt tends to use up quite a bit of fabric.However, I saw another reviewer say they were my height and that they worked, so I figured I’d give it a shot. If nothing else, I figured I would know quickly if they worked and could return them easily because I’m a Prime member.The Albury fit really comfortably in my normal size and were just long enough to be passable. They would have been better as a skinny Jean because then it would have tapered in at the ankle and the length would have looked more intentional/fashionable. As a bootcut, the flare hits at a point that I almost don’t like (past the ankle, but I can still feel the breeze), but works decently enough to keep them.I won’t be keeping the Betsy style. I don’t know if it’s because it’s a darker wash, but the Betsy fit tighter in the same size. It could be that same stiffness that causes the length to miss the mark. A few centimeters makes all the difference because the flare on the Betsy hits too high and brings these to high water territory. I’m not terribly sad about not keeping them because I also didn’t pay attention to the fact that the Betsy had gems on the back pocket, which is not my jam.",null

"Pentair Pentek WP5 Sediment Water Filter, 10-Inch, Under Sink Polypropylene String-Wound Filter Cartridge, 10"" x 2.5"", 5 Micron",Pentek,"This Pentek WP-5 string-wound polypropylene filter cartridge reduces fine sediment, rust, and scale particles for municipal drinking water and industrial fluid applications. It has a nominal filtration rating of 5 microns at an efficiency of 85%. The filter is made of polypropylene fiber cord that is wound in a precise pattern on a rigid polypropylene core for greater surface area, providing a higher dirt-loading capacity than standard wound cartridges. It has an initial pressure drop of less than 2.5 pounds per square inch (psi) at a maximum flow rate of 10 gallons per minute (gpm), and operates over a temperature range of 40 to 145 degrees F (4.4 to 62.8 degrees C). This string-wound filter cartridge is for use in various applications, including drinking water purification, irrigation, and industrial processes, among others. The nominal filtration rating is for a particle removal efficiency of 85%. H is height, the vertical distance from lowest to highest point; W is width, the horizontal distance from left to right; D is depth, the horizontal distance from front to back. Water filters remove undesirable particles, chemicals, and microorganisms from water by means of a semipermeable barrier, adsorption, or biological processes. They are made of densely packed synthetic or natural fibers that trap suspended particles, materials that block microbes or adsorb unwanted chemicals, or substances that cause a chemical change, such as acid neutralization. For most residential, commercial, and industrial applications, water filters are manufactured in the form of replaceable cartridges that fit inside permanent housings. Filtration systems typically consist of a series of two or more types of filters, each designed to remove different contaminants. The performance of filters is measured by the minimum particle size that is blocked, the percentage of particles or microorganisms that are removed, the downstream concentration of unwanted chemicals, the maximum flow rate, and the amount of water that can be filtered before the filter must be replaced. Water filters are used in a wide range of applications, including drinking water purification, swimming pools, industrial processes, and irrigation, among others. Pentair manufactures industrial, commercial, and residential water filtration components and systems. The company, founded in 1966 and headquartered in Minneapolis, MN, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards 9001 and 14001 for quality assurance.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Kitchen & Bath Fixtures"",""Water Filtration & Softeners"",""Replacement Water Filters"",""Replacement Under-Sink Water Filters""]",‏  ‎ Pentair Industries,,"Work great.

New Balance Men's FreezeLX V3 Agility Lacrosse Shoe,New Balance,"Designed for lacrosse players who push their limits, the New Balance FreezeLX v3 men's lacrosse cleat is designed to make you cut even harder. We kept the same Quixrail outer lugs for quick lateral cuts but increased the underfoot traction to get you more bite when starting and stopping and added a hybrid tongue to lock your ankle in place. The breathable synthetic material and mesh construction won't slow you down or hold you back as you sprint down the field.

My other pair is Nike Force Savage Shark size 7 football cleats. The Force Savage series are made for linemen. They are extra durable, well cushioned and fit comfortably when wearing ankle braces. These New Balance Freeze cleats are size 7.5. The size 7 are the same length, but have a tighter toe box. These NB are lighter and more agile. I can definitely feel the extra speed and make quicker cuts. The cleats are solidly punched into the dirt like no other, even on dry sandy turf. They are tighter, harder to get in and out, and harder to lace up than the Nikes, but not uncomfortably so, even with ankle braces. The Nike has better ankle protection for sure, as it covers the entire ankle. The NB are not as tall and allows the ankle to turn more. Overall, the Nike is more comfortable and the New Balance perform better.  I have also tried the Nike Alpha Huarache size 7. They are uncomfortably tight around the arch. If I had ordered a 7.5, my toes might have had too much room in front and not be able to use the front toe cleats of football and lacrosse shoes.",null

Needed to do quite a bit of carpentry to make it work. The plumbing part was easy, however, because of Pex and Sharkbite fittings. The valve works very well. See pictures. No stars removed because of the extra work, as I knew going in what was needed.Update: Very pleased with this valve. MUCH easier to regulate temperature than the single-handle valves I've seen, which are much more common in the US. Definitely worth the work to install it.It's easy to reset the temperature where the ""stop"" is; just remove the knob - first take out the chromed insert and remove the screw - and rotate the valve stem until the temperature suits you. Then replace the knob without moving the valve stem. You can always press the button and rotate the knob to make it hotter. Remove the red insert inside the knob if you want it still hotter when you press the button to go past the stop.Similarly, the flow control stop point can be adjusted by removing the flow knob (the right-hand knob) and replacing it in a different position. It will shut-off ""off-center"" but this is not a bother to any of us here. Pressing the button and turning the knob further increases the flow to the maximum, no matter where you replace the knob.","[""GROHE StarLight"",""GROHE CoolTouch"",""GROHE TurboStat"",""GROHE EcoJoy"",""MetalGrip ergonomic handle"",""SafeStop at 100°F / 38°C"",""EcoButton adjustable economy stop"",""Integrated mixed water shut off"",""Ceramic headpart 1⁄2\"", 180°"",""Shower bottom outlet 1⁄2\"";Built-in non-return valves;Dirt strainers;S-union 1⁄2\"" NPT;Protected against backflow;Wall mounted""]"

Frye Women's Jackie Button Short Boot,FRYE,"Mid heel bootie From the salon to the saloon, take Western heritage with you in FRYE's Jackie button short boot. This pint-sized cutie brimming with ten-gallon charm offers a leather upper and a scalloped silhouette--just like its big brothers of yore. The wooden heel lends up-to-the-minute trend appeal to the unadorned lines perfect for the cowgirl who attracts enough attention on her own. The Frye Company is the oldest continuously operated shoe company in the United States. Founded in 1863 by John A. Frye, a well-to-do shoemaker from England, and family-run until 1945, Frye products have a long and illustrious history. Frye boots were worn by soldiers on both sides of America's Civil War, soldiers in the Spanish-American war, and by Teddy Roosevelt and his Rough Riders. When home-steading drew adventurous New England families to the West during the mid and late 1800's many of the pioneers wore Frye Boots for the long journey. Today Frye remains true to its roots with its line of heritage boots, but continues to innovate as it introduces chic new handbags, pumps, and sandals to its collection. See more","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Boot Shop"",""Women"",""Fashion"",""Western""]",FRYE,womens,"I am a huge Frye fan and won't buy any other brand of boots anymore. I have been wanting a pair of short boots and debated over which style to get. I ended up ordering these at a great price in cognac, chocolate, and black.-COLOR- I loved the black the best with my wardrobe but my ankles are somewhat slender and my calves are somewhat large and the black pair had a larger opening than the other 2 colors and didn't look as good so I sent them back. Between the chocolate and cognac, the chocolate has a dressier look. It has a glossy finish and smooth, even coloring. The cognac is a matte finish with an uneven, more rugged coloring. Both were gorgeous but I favored the cognac.-SIZING- I am usually a 7.5 in other brands for closed toed shoes. I always order an 8 in Frye boots. I would say that these run slightly smaller than other Frye boots I own but I would not need to change sizes to wear them.-TOE BOX- The toe box is pointed and therefore naturally narrower than rounded or square toe box styles. The heel also causes my foot to be more forward in the shoe than a flatter heel. I have a slightly wider toe area and was concerned about my toes feeling pinched into the pointy space.-SHAFT OPENING- The shaft opening is quite wide compared to the other Frye short boots I have tried on. I have a slender ankle and wide calf so balancing the shaft opening size with my features can be a little tricky. They look great with skinny jeans and easily fit over them but look like they are swallowing me up in tights and styles of pants that are fitted around the ankle.In the end, I purchased the phillip harness short which features a shorter heel, a rounded toe box, and a narrower shaft opening. The Jackie Button Short is an awesome style though! I would have kept both if I could and worn these exclusively with skinny jeans. I may reorder in the future.UPDATE: A few months after I posted this review, they added Ice Grey as a color option. I knew this was the pair I would end up with if I was going to try this style again. I saved up my spending money and ordered them last week. The color is absolutely gorgeous! Gray is my favorite neutral and I love this color so much that I ended up ordering the Melissa Foldover purse in it as well! I have had them for quite a while now and I can say the toe box molded around my foot shape and are comfortable. I cannot wear them standing or walking all day but I can wear them to church or around town shopping for a couple of hours before feeling like I should change shoes. This is only the case because of the shape of my toes. Love them!",null

As a brand born for life outside, KEEN has a responsibility to protect and conserve the places where all people live, play and work.","[""Clothing, Shoes & Jewelry"",""Women"",""Shoes"",""Sandals"",""Flats""]",KEEN,Womens,"Actually, I didn't really know what to expect with the size because I'm a man and these are women's sandals. A size 9 Keen fits me perfectly and I found a conversion table online that indicated women's shoes are 1.5 sizes higher than men's (Why the heck this is, I'll never know), so I took advantage of the new ""Prime Wardrobe"" feature (more on this later) to order two pairs of Keen's women's sandals. To be on the safe side, I ordered one pair, women's size 10.5 (These, the ""Crabapple” model) and another women's size 11. The size 11 sandals were only slightly too long and the size 10.5 were slightly too narrow, so the conversion rule isn't perfect; but only ""slightly"" off. As I know these shoes stretch, slightly, with wear, I went with these 10.5 shoes and returned the othersI love these sandal/shoes by Keen. They are comfortable, colorful, and very well made. I wear them year round, but they are particularly great in the summer because, like flip-flops, they allow your feet to breathe and stay cool, but remain in place and present no problems in term of walking or running. I already have three pairs and I've been on the lookout for more. They are by no means as cheap as flip-flops so I can't afford to indulge myself with other shades of blue, green, and brown (and Keen offer a wide variety of these shades plus other colors) so I've been looking for distinctly different colors. This Fig/Crabapple model caught my eye because of the color which is a little more of an orange shade than the pinkish shown in the photo (A good thing IMO). The problem was it is only offered in a woman's model. While there may be a difference in the design of Keen men's sandals and their women's version, I can't detect it, so it really only came down to the sizing. 10.5 isn’t perfect, but if they stretch only a little bit, it will be. I don’t foresee using my new found knowledge of shoe sizing to purchase a lot of women’s shoes for myself. For me, at least, it’s only applicable for shoes or sandals that are basically unisex to begin with and I think these Keen sandals are just that.A word on Prime Wardrobe: I assume, by the name, that it is only available to Prime Members but if you shop with any regularity you really do need to become a member. You will recoup the membership fee on shipping costs savings alone, plus you receive all sorts of great extras. Now Prime Wardrobe is one of them and it too is great. Briefly, you can order up to 8 articles of clothing and have them shipped to you within a few days. You pay ZERO $, and this applies to shipping too. After the items arrive, you have 7 days to try them on for size, judge the colors and designs in the real world, and do just about anything else you might normally do when shopping in a bricks & mortar retail store. If you want to keep one, more or all of the items, you don't have to do anything (although Amazon requests you go to your online order and indicate your intent to keep them) Whenever you advise Amazon you want to keep one or more items, or after seven days from receipt, you will be billed at the item's price at the time of your original order. If you decide not to keep something you simply return to the original order and indicate you are returning it. Doing so is a breeze. The items are shipped to you with a prepaid return UPS label and the box the items arrived in has a resealing sticker attached. All you have to do reseal the box (with the returns inside :) ) slap on the label and drop it off at your nearest UPS store. At no point is there any cost to you.Obviously the returned items can't be damaged or display obvious wear and you are supposed to return them in their original packing, but these are hardly unreasonable requirements. This is my first use of the feature and so I can't report on whether or not the return smoothly finalizes, but I've no concern that it won't. Amazon may have thought, when putting this feature together, that some buyers will not get around to returning goods they don't really want and will end up paying for them, but I don’t think it’s, at a major concept for them. I know this is a motivation of other retail sites that offer this sort of ""Test For Free"" feature but the one's I've seen, charge your credit card upfront and issue a credit when the returned goods are received, and/or make it unnecessarily difficult to return any items. This is definitely not the case with Amazon. Pretty sure that their primary motivation for offering this feature is to capture sales they might have been losing because the buyer wasn't comfortable purchasing items without a test-run. Unless something goes bad with the return (which I don't at all expect to happen) there is absolutely no trickery involved with Prime Wardrobe. I intend to use it all of the time from now on.",null

I was drinking G2 and had no issues, but its quite expensive here so I wanted to order in powder. The only G2 powder I could find in bulk was a single flavor and a single flavor gets old very quickly.I came across this 50lb box of 4 sqwincher flavors. I read the reviews and they were generally positive, and I even searched and read for reviews external to Amazon. When it arrived I was a bit concerned about all the coloring in it and felt myself wishing they made it without coloring, no matter what color that made the flavors. I never know how prophetic my concerns about the coloring would be.While drinking the liquid G2 (never tried powder, but I assume its the same general formula) I never noticed any changes in my digestion. And aside from the fact that the G2 Orange flavor I find detestable, Grape and Fruit Punch were just dandy.Sqwincher arrived and I switched over too it. I even mixed it a little bit weaker than the instructions as I drink it throughout the day and need to make sure I am also drinking equal parts water or more than I do of sports drink.On the 4th day or so my poop started turning colors. And I don't mean just a little bit. The first sign was the day I pooped a Chernobyl green log after drinking the grape flavor. Until I realized what it was and that the color was such an odd color that there was no way my body could have produced that on its own, I had a short panic attack. No one should ever have to see this color turd exit from their body.The next day I tried lemon lime flavor. And the next morning I produced a log surrounded in a halo of what best could be described as ectoplasmic slime from Ghostbusters. Slimer had slimed my poop.Sqwincher tastes good, even the orange is palatable to me (unlike G2 orange). But I don't know long I can poop rainbows..... unfortunately I now have 50 lbs of the stuff as well.......If you want to produce Smurf poop among others, you've found a winner.All our guys like Sqwincher, there's nothing wrong with the product. But it's just a bit expensive, so beware if you find a good deal on it - you might run into a situation like we did where the seller deceives you and only sends you two *PACKETS* of the mix instead of two *CASES* despite the fact that the product description clearly indicates that it's being sold by the case. When we complained, they ended up refunding our money since they were suddenly ""out of stock"" on the product, but it was an unfortunate situation..Not very sweet - mostly refreshing in the heat. We used this instead of a Gatorade mix for our back to school event for kids and youth.I own and operate a lawn business . We work in 90-100 degree weather regularly. This seems to be a success. We all enjoy the flavors and I can personally say with assurance that it makes us feel better than when. We use to just drink water.Tastes ok, but they put too much dye in their drink powder. For example the purple is so dark it's nearly black even when it's not made full strength.Perfect for the summer time blues.

It was a little thinner than I expected, but I’m using it as a bedspread. I wanted something I could easily wash without filling up an entire load. It’s super silky soft. This WAS perfect, but my cat loves it too. He has destroyed it with his claws simply by kneading his paws on the softness. I cut the tails of the snags but I think this made it worse because now I have holes.I should have tried washing it to see if that would pull the snags back into place. I would order another because I loved this blanket, but I know he will do the same to another. I’ll have to replace it with something claw proof. Sigh, I can’t have anything nice.

But, as awesome as smart phones are, I found myself frequently wishing I had something in between, for things I didn't really need to drag out the laptop for, but for which the smart phone wasn't quite enough for the task at hand, just due to the limitations of it's size.Enter, the tablet.  While, for a time, I didn't get the idea of such devices, thinking it was just a way to play Angry Birds in more spectacular fashion, and found it actually rather laughable when someone held up a half-cookie-sheet sized tablet to snap a photo of something, the purchase of my Nexus 7 converted me to embracing the ""Tech Trifecta"" of laptop, tablet, and smart phone -- I now have a bridge device perfectly suited to those jobs that are in between what is too much for my phone but which does not require the full resources of my laptop.And, along with the solution, enter the problem, which is that, like other portable devices, for knocking out serious work few mobile machines (including tablets) have adequate keyboards or mouse-like functions to expedite and make-friendly text-based tasks.  For my laptop, I solved the problem long ago by getting a full size external keyboard and mouse (and even have an external monitor for when I'm really logging the hours).  For the phone, I did have a slider smart phone with a Qwerty keyboard for as long as such phones were being made, but I finally had to give that up, once the phones with the most powerful and useful features for business (or fun) were eschewing ""out-dated"" keyboard concepts in favor of total touch screen tech -- which became a greater limitation of phone use for work tasks, even more highlighting the need for a tablet.But, the tablet itself, I found, had the same limitation.  A stylus made navigation easier, but, in terms of heavy typing, although larger, the touchscreen keyboard was still....a touchscreen keyboard.  Yes, virtual keyboards are getting better and better, but, still, for any real work, the tappity tap on a screen just doesn't cut it, at least not for me as a touch typist.  So, it seemed that perhaps my grand new bridge device was going to turn out to be a bridge too far....Enter the hero -- the Microsoft Wedge Mobile Keyboard!  This Bluetooth device is a GEM!!!!  While small enough to be very portable, they have sized it just large enough to be wonderfully easy to type on, so much so that I now rely on it for any situation where I need to send a reply or create a document of more than a few lines.  It just, hands down, beats any touch screen keyboard, in my opinion, and frankly lays waste to many physical keyboards three times its size.Set up is a breeze -- pop off the sturdy top cover (which doubles, for me, as a base to put my Nexus 7 on, when in it's stand, to give it a perfect height for viewing), and it automatically powers on, and your device already knows its little keyboard buddy (after you've completed the super short initial one time set up -- unless you need to re-pair it, but I will mention that later), and, wow, you are instantly typing away at your heart's content.I love that the cover doubles as a power off -- no worry about ever accidentally draining the two AAA batteries -- just put the cover back on, and the keyboard powers itself off.  I have yet to even change the batteries after steady use since I bought it, which is going on a few month's now.Further awesomeness is provided by the fact that the battery compartment beneath the keyboard itself doubles as a built in stand for what the keyboard rests on, putting it at a perfect typing angle.For typing, the keys are crisp and sure, very nicely spaced for such a compact device, and the layout is such that it is not the kind of keyboard design that is frustrating to use or prone to encourage typos with hard-to-hit keys.  Typing is sure, quick and fluid.  There is no lag whatsoever from what you type to what appears as fast as you type it.As if that wasn't enough, the cover/lid is designed as an instant device stand -- just bend it to any angle you want and you can prop a device in it, voila!  Pairing is quick and problem free at first set-up -- at the end of battery compartment is the Bluetooth discovery button, just press and hold and wait for your device to see the keyboard, type in the code it gives, and, as I say, you have an instant and very functional keyboard standing by for any amount of use.I love it even more because of course, it connects to any Bluetooth device, which meant that, just two days after getting it, being out in the field with my laptop, but with none of my ""make tasks friendlier"" laptop accessories, I realized my new keyboard was in my briefcase with my tablet, and, TA DA, instead of using the less-than-convenient laptop keyboard, I just paired the Wedge Keyboard to my laptop, and was off and running.Even more hilarious was pairing it to my smartphone, the next day, when I was without my laptop or tablet, and, instead of the tedious job of answering an email with the phone's small touch keyboard, I paired up my Wedge Keyboard to save the day.Drawbacks?  None, for me.  This is one of the best tech accessory products I've purchased.  You might find that it is not super light when packing it around with you but, I think you'll appreciate, as I do, the solid and sturdy design.  A few extra ounces is worth the quality it exudes.How could it get better?  Well, I think a new tech that is coming out, eventually, is the ability for one Bluetooth device to ""remember"" all the devices it ""talks"" which would eliminate the need to un-pair and re-pair the keyboard when switching from one device to another.  So, I can only say that a future improvement (given that I now use it on three devices) would be adding such a feature to it in future designs.  But, given that pairing from device to device takes just a few seconds, that's nitpicking, lol, and only speaks further to how great the keyboard is, given that I now want to use it on multiple devices.If mobility combined with functionality is your goal, the little workhorse takes the cake.Oh -- and yes, I did type this using my trusty new Wedge Keyboard so, given that's this review IS a bit long, you can thank (or not thank, depending on your view of this review, lol) my new typing ally for being so easy to use that you just can go on and on and on and on.....Highly recommend this great device!* UPDATE:  Jan 2014 -- Just wanted to add, nearly eight months have gone by with regular use on a periodic basis, and I still have not needed to change the batteries.  Amazing!  LOVE THIS KEYBOARD!","[""Multi-purpose cover powers down device and converts into a tablet stand"",""Windows 8 shortcut keys"",""Bluetooth provides wireless connectivity without a transceiver"",""Works with most tablets for fast, comfortable typing"",""Light-touch keys for easy typing"",""Media keys for music and video control"",""Battery status indicator"",""Windows Start key""]"

Read more Attention: One Important Thing for Buyers There's a BIG difference: Car Cooler vs Car Freezer ! --- Electric Cooler operates by constantly running a fan to lower the interior's temperature. It will cool as fast or slow as the outside ambient temperature. What that means is that if it's hot outside, it'll take a very long time to get the inside down to 57℉. If it is cold outside, it will reach 51℉ faster and more consistently. --- Car Freezer have a built-in compressor just like a fridge at home. It can take the inside from 77℉ ambient temperature down to 40℉ in 20 -25 mins, then to freezing temps of 32℉ or below after another 15 -20 mins. Unlike Electric Coolers, the car freezer does not need to have its compressor running all the time either. They simply stop once the desired temp is reached, then turns on again after a threshold temperature differential is surpassed. --- Electric Cooler: - Can cool down to 55℉, if it is not too hot outside. This is why ice cubes cannot be placed in the electric cooler, because it is not a refrigerator, its cooling temperature is much higher than 0 degrees , and ice cubes will melt quickly. - Fan needs to constantly run to maintain temperature. - Cannot set temperature. It's usually just Cold or Hot. - Easier to carry around the park or beach for a picnic. a car freezer tends to be heavier and larger. --- Car Freezer: - Can cool to any desired temperature between -20℉ and 60℉ - Cannot heat things. It's designed to cool or freezer like a home refrigerator - Compressor and fan only run until desired temp is reached, taking up less power overall. 1. This cooler cannot replace a fridge. So if you need a fridge better go buy a fridge. 2. It keeps food or drinks cool enough if you don’t jam pack the inside of the bag. one strategy is to keep some space between items inside so air can circulate for it to cool.","[""Automotive"",""Interior Accessories"",""Electrical Appliances"",""Coolers & Refrigerators""]",‎YAPASPT,,"I almost didn't order this cooler because of a few reviews saying it didn't keep things cool enough. It seems to me that everything is very cool. We used the cooler on a 5 day trip and it worked great. We could use it in the car and in the motel rooms and loved not fooling with heavy ice. The side pockets are a great feature. The only negative I can find is the plug in location at the bottom of the cooling unit.I bought this a few days before a 3-week long solo road trip. It's not a refrigerator but it keeps food & drinks cool and fresh. I put it on the floor of the passenger seat so I could easily reach things. It came with 3 DC cords that are long enough to run from a DC plug in the back seat up to the cooler in the front so I could use the front outlets for my phone, etc. It ran quietly for long hours of driving. It also comes with an AC outlet adaptor so I took it into my hotel rooms each night and plugged it in. I was able to store sandwiches, leftovers from meals, water, sodas, snacks, etc. in it for the entire trip with no issues. I have been very happy with this item.The zipper broke on the first day of our 4 day drive. Luckily I could use the zipper on the other side to shut it completely. Also, be aware, the paperwork included says that it cools to 50 degrees. I want super computable keeping all the different foods at only 50 degrees-especially meats. So…make sure your food is already chilled down or even frozen. For our return trip of driving 4 days, we added zip lock bags of ice. To me, this defeats the purpose. I won’t be getting another one. And can only recommend for shorter trips.This certainly fit a lot of things in it but was very heavy when full. I purchased an accessory plug to use it inside when going from the car. Kept everything temp controlled.Give it as a gift to my friend who just got a new car, and we have been out several times using it. I originally got it for cold beverages, and it works perfectly in that scenario. It holds the temperature well, is waterproof, and is easy to clean. Any standard wine bottle can fit in it fine, and there is an inserted divider that can keep things in place and organized.But I have to mention that we use it for take-outs in most cases. Besides keeping food hot, it also prevents the smell of food leak into the car! We are both very happy about it!Not worth the money. It doesn't really cool or keep things cool. 15 Celsius below 38 (100.4 fahrenheit) is 23 Celsius (73.4 fahrenheit).But it said + or - 2 so really it was 25 Celsius (77 fahrenheit).My food and drinks were 80° when it was 100° and I should have saw it only lowers 15° below ambient temperature. It's cool to have like a prototype or something but not very useful.Took this on vacation. Kept drinks and snacks cool. Not really cold. Liked not having to deal with melted ice.I run local am out 11 to 14 hours a day and the drinks are nice and fridge cold by time I go home. I can load it up with tons of 24oz drinks and my lunch I have even had a salad stay nice and crisp in there for 8 hours befor I got to it. I do add some cheap ice packs in the am just to help it along in the cooling but it stays nice and cold all day. Tons of room for all you will need in a 14hr period the pockets are excellent for all my personal items throughout the day it's taken place of my backpack. Very worth the price.The cooler is fine but the car charger end broke within a week of using the cooler. I have Asurion warranty but I’ve called 3 times and chatted online, and they haven’t gotten me the part yet. They all gave different information each time and keep saying they will call me back but no one ever calls me back. It’s been 9 months now and I’m still trying to get this part. I wouldn’t bother with getting Asurion warranty - seems to have been a big waste of time.The cooling mechanism is on the side.. your can't put anything that will block the incoming cool air. With another words you can't filled it up with anything cos everything you put in it actually blocks the airway. The cooling should be on the lid. It is useless. And the convertor gets way too hot right awayThe fan was so noisy I couldn't put it in the back seat and listen to the radio. Cooling works but is minimal. On the positive side, it held a bunch of ice without leaking.Vraiment de mauvaise qualité , la courroie à bandoulière pour transporter sur l’epaule As lâché après une semaine et le connecteur de l’allume cigarette as fondu après 1 mois !!!!160$ de perduJe ne recommande vraiment pasBought this cooler for my hubby to use in his semi for his drinks. It's the perfect size. He keeps in handy on the passenger seat so he can always have a cold drink when he wants one. He used the long strap to secure it over the back of the seat so the cooler stays securely in place. Very happy with this.","[""NEW COOLER FOR VEHICLES - Different from traditional ice packs, it is a mini cooler that can be connected to the car for cooling foods and drinks, but more lightweight, soft and convenient than traditional plastic refrigerator.

It helps no matter the razor I use, but as an African-American man, I still need to be cautious because if the razor causes me to bump heavily, Bump Patrol will not prevent all razor bumps. First, find the best shaving platform for your skin type and use Bump Patrol as an added layer of protection from razor bumps or help reduce razor bumps after a major breakout. For me, Andis Styliner II clippers work best for dry shaving my face and head. Bump Patrol helps to keep me utterly free of razor bumps when I use the clippers. However, when I use Bump Fighter safety razors which give me a closer shave, Bump Patrol helps the occasional trapped hair to break free before a severe razor bump can form. My BRAUN shaver worked but caused a deep razor bump that eventually turned into a cyst that Bump Patrol could not prevent. Bump Patrol is not a magic wand, but it's a great tool to have in the fight against razor bumps.I've been using this product for decades! Extremely happy with my results.I have been looking forward to reviewing this for quite a while, and awaiting a time when I can express all of my thoughts to everyone.So I have had 3 large bumps on my neck for god knows how long. They never get any bigger or smaller, but they have always just been there. Clearly they were/are an effect of improper shaving at some point or another. No matter what I have tried, the size of those bumps has never gone down at all. I have been very self conscious about that for quite some time.I read a lot of good reviews for this product, and figured it could not hurt to give it a try. So here is my journey.I typically shave every other day, as I am not a fan of facial hair, especially on my neck. As I began using this product, I stretched it to every three days, and then again to every four days. I figured this would give my neck the longest opportunity to heal. All during this time, I continued to use this product, everyday, usually once in the morning, and once at night. I also used it every time after I shaved. And each time I shaved, I made sure to take extra special care on my neck, to ensure I would not regress or become worse.After a week of use, I did not notice too much of a change. Two weeks, slight change for the better, and this continued on gradually. I am now on four weeks, and it is a world of difference. I truly wish I had taken a before picture, so I could post before and after pictures. While not completely gone (just yet), those three bumps on my neck are remarkably smaller than they were when I started using this product. They are practically non-existent at this point. When I see myself in the mirror, I can tell they have definitely shrunk. When I blindly feel at my neck with my hand, I can barely feel the current largest bump, as it has almost completely disappeared.I cannot say enough good things about this product. If you suffer or have a similar issue, I strongly encourage you to give this product a try, and to have patience. You probably will not notice immediate results, but I can attest that it is worth the patience and effort.Works okay … I get bumps pretty bad after shaving and when I use this I still get bumps but not as much as I did without itSo far haven’t found anything that works better than thisLove this product. I have very sensitive skin after shaving and break out with large, red bumps. This product has greatly reduced the number of bumps and their size. Probably 80% less and the remaining are much less noticeable. Highly recommend.healing effectivenessNot oily and works.Have been using this product for so many year. Until recently when i bought a butch that felt thin and diluted. A few days later ended up with burnt skin. Now i have to wear make up to cover my burns.Used product previously with no issues for several years. The new product causes a severe itchy rush. When washing it off and accidentally gets in the eyes, itchy and swollen eye lids. Just been to doctors.Update: 4 days after getting burning session all over the face ( especially around the eyes), the old irritatedskin turned rough and dark is flaking and coming off. I have been applying an emollient cream to sooth the contaminated areas.I have been using this product for over 8 years, but last time I ordered it I had a reaction to it. It was so severe I had to take medication. Believing I had become allergic to it for some reason I offered the used once bottle to a friend who also uses it only to be told that he had stopped using it because it brought him out in a rash! He also had to get medication. I don’t know what has been changed but I wouldn’t use this product again and think it should be checked!this product was so wrong for me. made my skin itchy even other parts of my face got affected thankfully i had some of my current aftershave remaining which got me out of my predicament. im of the mind to ask for refund but dont know if its worth itI ordered 3 units of the 113ml and the seller sent 6 units of the 57ml. I had problems with the 57ml version last year. I had uncontrollable itching and lots of bumps. I had to take medication. I think something changed in the formula since summer 2018 or there are fakes in the market. I don’t trust the 57ml anymore and I’ll be returning it to the seller.

It did well on the lower-pile carpets at my old place, but the high-pile rugs in my new home practically made it immovable. I was rather nervous about getting a plastic glide mat for the chair because of the large number of accidents reported when the rolled mats suddenly exploded to full size when removed from the packaging.I'm disabled, and it can be really difficult to get up at times, and when the chair is immovable, it can be an issue. I was lucky enough to come upon these while poking around the Amazon site one evening, and I decided to give these wheels a try. I'm happy that I did! The wheels allow the chair to move a bit, although the movement is not always smooth, and I need to rock a bit to get the wheels out of the carpet grooves.That's really the only (very small) complaint that I have about them. The important thing is that I can move without too much effort, and I can push back my chair and get to my feet in an efficient manner. It also added about an inch of height to my chair, which always helps!I give it five stars because it actually does work a bit on high-pile carpeting. Just don't expect to be able to glide about the room as you could on a wood floor.Also, as a footnote, if you have trouble removing the old wheels (as I did). there are many videos online that will guide you through safely removing them.","[""[Universal & Premium] Designed for universal compatibility - offers a direct replacement solution for almost any rolling chair with standard stem.

The basic mint and cinnamon flavors are all good, as is the bubble gum. The chocolate mint was tasty at first but faded too quickly for me, and the pomegranate mint was...kinda gross. Idk, I just really didn't like that one. It's like a fruity sour mint flavor, not for me.The gum is fairly soft but the pieces are REALLY tiny. I don't want huge wads of gum in my mouth, but one piece chews down to be the size of a large green pea. It's small as heck, so I wound up chewing two pieces at a time. Not a huge deal breaker but it does make you go through the packs more quickly.This sample pack is a great way to try the different flavors of this gum in easy-to-carry packets. I like all the flavors, but my favorites were the chocolate mint, pomegranate mint, and bubblegum.While the flavor is bold and wonderful for the first minute or two, it goes away quickly after that. The mint gums continue to keep your mouth clean and fresh for a little while after, but if this company finds a way to increase the longevity of the flavor without compromising the integrity of the ingredients, that would be great.Good for you dental health.Good for keeping glucose levels in check.Good for after meals when you don’t have time or can’t brush.Taste good too!Flavor and sweetness last a long time!Easy to chew but flavor doesn't last long.I love this gum and the flavor. Like most gum the flavor just doesn’t last a super long time but I love the ingredients and it’s a healthier choice for our kid.Taste is significantly better than sugar free gum that uses artificial sweeteners. The consistency is a tad different than what I’m used to but it’s not unpleasant by any means.I love this brand. Flavors are really good and ingredients as well....I wish the flavor would last a little longer!Haven't had these in awhile and these were perfect for reminding me which flavors are good.I get everything about aspartame and that it is bad for you which is why I decided to try this product. The taste is perfectly fine but for about a minute then it's gone. I guess if you want to finish the whole pack in 9 minutes go for it but I wouldn't recommend buying this.Aspartame gives me headaches. Had to look for an alternative chewing gum as all chewing gum now, even the ones filled with sugar, have aspartame in it. This is the answer! Chewy, tasty, pleasant.I got these when they were on offer. It was the first time that i was trying them. Not great, flavor does not last long at all, and although I got them at a reasonable price i still don't think they were worth the price I paid. As soon as you chew it for a few seconds the flavor has gone. Not worth it, would not buy againThese are okay - bit of a 'mouthwash' taste to them. I prefer the cinnamon ones, they seem to be a bit chewier than these but if you're using these after meals to give your teeth a bit of a clean then you can't go far wrong!The information on the back of the packet is not as advertised. 67g of carbs is very HIGH! Being on keto is why l brought this product. I hate false advertising!","[""WINTERGREEN: This sugar free gum has a refreshingly icy mint flavor.

I had supposed that I was a better swimmer than I was, and found that I needed the handles to be on the front of the kickboard, and not the back to support me while trying to swim. It's evident by the indexing on the handholds which direction you're suppose grip the board, but there is no reason you can't hold on the opposite edge. I needed more floating support than the ""A"" shape provided and flipping it the opposite way wasn't supportive enough.

Folding the legs back up is also tricky using your left hand its super easy to fold the left leg but you have to contort your wrist to push the button on the right side to fold the leg.  Again I am sure practice will make it easier but its something I noticed.The pan and tilt are a single adjustment that is in a sort of inconvenient place if you are used to the Harris system with a lever add on this is certainly an adjustment you will have to make. Maybe someone will make a lever that can be added to nut for this bipod.Also it seems no matter how tight you get that nut it won't lock out either adjustment and it seems to loosen once you start using it.  So if you love the fact that you can set and lock your Harris that might be a deal breaker for you.  Its not for me, with the nut very tight you can set the tilt and it will stay put, just not locked as solid as a Harris would be.There is a slight rattle to the bipod the fit between the polymer outer shell of the bipod and the metal inner legs is a tiny bit loose and it does make a very small amount of noise.  Its nothing major, its not loud but it is there.Overall this bipod is good, it has good features, seems very well made, is strong, lightweight and durable.  Its just not quite as good as a Harris for precision shooting since you cant easily lock the tilt/pan.I would recommend it but just know the limitations of the product.","[""Mil-spec hard anodized 6061 T-6 aluminum"",""Stainless steel internals"",""Spring-tensioned legs stow neatly forward and snap down"",""Leg extensions slide and lock securely with the push of a button"",""Staggered soft rubber feet hold fast on a variety of shooting surfaces""]"

The lights will all be separated. Step5: Take all the small stars in your hand and unlock them a few times in the opposite direction of the winding. The lights will all be separated.

They’re very difficult to untangle. I tried for a few hours to untangle these and eventually gave up. Instead of hanging them on the wall like I intended I just put the tangled clump on top of a bookshelf out of view and let what I could untangle hang down on either side. I’m keeping them since I was able to make it work, but I’m basically only able to use about half the string of lights.2. They’re very fragile- I dropped the lights on the carpet by accident and a few of the pieces were slightly damaged, however they all still work.3. The plastic is very strong smelling. After 3 days I still smell the plastic, it’s not a big deal but I hope it will eventually go away.Overall, they look nice, but not the bestMy husband and I love these lights it took us about 10 minutes to detangle and hang up we bought some for a YouTube background but also something that we can set up in our pavilion since we are in the sca and belegarth we are looking for new ways to make our tent home it's about 500 square feet and were doing tarot as well so it will be a cute feature for reading the cards at night if we deside to do a reading at night their about as bright as my salt lamp so if you happen to have one of those that's how bright they are. I love all the settings and they are bigger than I thought they would be but we will order more sets to go around our tent. I'm most likely going to get a water tight container to put over our power plugs. I figured I would post how big the stars and moons were with a hand point of view, my hands are tiny so I used my husband's as well for different reference sizes. I wish we could change the color since our fighting units color is blue it would be cool to have it customizable like some led strips but the warm light is very comforting and romantic. Thanks for a great product and we will buy again to extend our chain. I will add that you can have the electric plug on either side so that's a bonus you dont have to worry about what side to plug it in on.* I only used the light for 1 day only because I just received it, so this is an initial judgement, and I will update if I noticed anything wrong about the product.The order arrived in a good condition.The rod of lights was well packed but tangled a little bit not much, but don’t be scared, just follow the directions that came with the product and in no time you’ll untangle it and will be ok.It have a lot of light effects like flash and fast winks and soft effects, I liked the soft fade effect and the steady lights the best, because all the other effects are kind of loud and annoying for my eyes.**DON’T cut the plastic ties because it is what makes the shape of the light rod .Thank you.Love these lights very bright and very good in size unlike other really small ones these are huge, I wish they comes with a remote and different modes though.Pictures are deceptive for size, especially in comparison to other sellers. BUT other than the size I wouldn't change anything about the entire experience from beginning to end! Well, maybe order another strip!

Physicians Formula Murumuru Butter Bronzer| Cream Shimmer Makeup| Light Bronzer,Physicians Formula,"Add a touch of warmth to your complexion with the help of Physicians Formula Murumuru Butter Bronzer. Feel the rejuvenating power of murumuru butter, tucuma butter, and cupuaçu butter, as they work together to restore, moisturize and protect your skin. Lusciously creamy and formulated especially for sensitive skin, this bronzer applies smoothly while serving as the perfect base for a number of artistic and natural looks. This bronzer serves as a perfect base for other Physicians Formula Murumuru Butter makeup, such as our series of blendable cream eyeshadows, blushes, highlighters, and lip creams. About Physicians Formula: It all started in 1937, when leading allergist Dr. Frank Crandall created Physicians Formula as an expression of love for his wife Edith, who suffered from lupus and longed for makeup that wouldn’t aggravate her sensitive skin. Since then, we have continued Dr. Crandall’s concept of “healthy beauty.” To this day, every one of our products is carefully crafted and tested to meet our strict requirements: they are hypoallergenic, safe for sensitive skin and eyes, and created without any of the 150+ known harsh ingredients found in other personal care items.Package Includes: Bronzer (1) Size: 0.38 oz.

I needed a new bronzer but the color of this didn’t really give me a bronze look. I like the way it covered up however, it did make me look a little bit like a corpse LOL! . I think maybe I just ordered the wrong color but I was looking for something more like being Sunkist and this color definitely did not do it for me. I am fair skinned and I didn’t want to go too dark and read other reviews which recommended this number two bronzer. The coverage was good just not the right color so maybe I have to try a different shade.I’ve never had a better smelling skincare product. Color is subtle and nice but I’d put this on for the smell alone!I do not have sensitive skin so I can’t review on that aspect. I love this powdered bronzer it is lightweight with a silky texture and a mellow scent. I live in a hot area this product is not “heavy” on my skin.and does no settle in my wrinkles like a liquid foundation can…I have been using this product for years!I’m light skinned and you can’t even see this on me, I’m guessing it’s for very fair tones. Smells amazing though, like a beachy coconut scent. I will order a darker color!Love this product!! 3rd time purchasingLooks goodBe sure to order the dark shade. Anything lighter cannot be seen. Blends great, looks natural. Can be used lightly as bronzer, can be used darker as contour.So pigmented i’ll buy it againThis product arrived to me in perfect conditions. The formula is really soft and buttery, and the fragrance is quite nice. Very happy with this product. But I need to say something about the shade match: if you have an olive/ golden skin tone, or if you have the average southern European/Mediterranean pale skin and like a chiselled contour, or a golden tan finish, this shade may be to light for you. I have pale skin with an yellowish undertone, I like subtle makeup finish, and the fact that this shade doesn't really stand out, makes it great for me. But if you're not about natural makeup looks, try the darker shade.Butter Bronzer in der Farbe Light BronzerKurz und Knapp :)- Ansprechendes Design- Wunderschöner Kokosduft (Urlaubsfeeling garantiert)- Der Bronzer lässt sich aufgrund der tollen, weichen Konsistenz gut auftragen, verblenden sowie aufbauen- Er hat einen schönen leichten Schimmer (kein Glitzer)- Gutes Preis - LeistungsverhältnisDie Fotos sowie den Swatch auf meinem Unterarm habe ich bei Tageslicht gemacht damit man sich (so hoffe ich) einen guten Eindruck machen kann.Product smells like coconut and feels great, but mine arrived broken so I’m a little bit gutted about that.I have been after this for so long, then amazon price dropped it so I had to get it. It obviously isn't the the cheapest bronzer in the world, due to it being sent from US (it is a US product, so I expected to pay a bit more). The packaging is gorgeous, and it's great that it's travel friendly with a flip up mirror attached. The coconut smell is lovely, but after a while it does get a bit sickly, but nothing unbearable. The bronzer is very lovely, and applies very smoothly, almost like a cream bronzer. I got the light shade, as I'm quite pale with a neutral/yellow undertone, and this colour is perfect for me!","[""WARM ISLAND GLOW - Give your face the radiant goddess glow of the tropics Pick your color and watch your look gently transform as the refined pearls and soft-focus pigments smooth and brighten your skin tone with a subtle shimmer finish"",""NOURISHING AND MOISTURIZING - Made with a blend of murumuru butter, cupuaçu butter, and tucuma butter from the nutrient-rich Amazon, this makeup is packed with essential fatty acids and pro-vitamins that soften, condition, and moisturize the skin"",""SMOOTH APPLICATION - Whether you use a makeup brush or even just your fingers, cosmetics from the Murumuru Butter Collection glide on with ease and seamlessly blend into the skin for attractive all-day coverage"",""MADE FOR SENSITIVE SKIN - Physicians Formula makeup is specifically formulated with your health and comfort in mind That's why we use high-quality hypoallergenic and natural ingredients, leaving you looking and feeling beautiful from the inside out"",""CRUELTY-FREE – All Physicians Formula foundations, eye makeup, lipsticks, and other cosmetics are always cruelty-free and never test on animals"",""Skin type: Combination""]"

The couch is a beautiful teal and very comfortable. It's the kind of comfortable that isn't a sink into once you sit down, which is the type of comfortable I like. It's more of comfy back cushions, with a bit firmer seating cushions. This means that is great for your back, and the couch cushions will age well with fewer indents in the cushions.Amazon was amazing too, the 1st couch I got had only one flaw. One of the back cushions was short. It was like I got a loveseat cushion, instead of two regular sized back couch cushions. I let Amazon know and they sent a new one out right away. Took only a week! They also told me that the delivery company will pick up the old one when the new one came.My only issue was with the delivery company itself! Amazon told me that the return would be no issue on my part, but the company refused to come up to get it from my apartment to get the old couch, or to bring up the new one! I had to carry the old one down three flights of stairs, and then bring the new one up three flights of stairs. I'm just one small girl! The person delivering refused to help at all! Thank goodness I had a friend there to help me, or it would have never happened. Horrible delivery company for not doing what I assume Amazon contracted them for. The new couch should have been delivered to my door, and then the old one removed like Amazon promised! I'm not blaming Amazon since they contract a moving company to do this, I am blaming the delivery company. I pray Amazon chooses another company for the future since can this can be a deal breaker for a lot of people.In conclusion: The couch itself is wonderful!

I found SeekOptics and with coupon two sets of polarized lenses: Black Iridium Polarized and Blue Mirror Polarized cost less than $40! Oakley replacement glasses can range from $70-$110, so to get two polarized lenses is crazy.So performance-wise these lenses are 100% the same as Oakley in terms of polarization. Where the Seek Optics version differs is that: it doesn't have the Oakley branding, it doesn't say polarized, and the lens itself isn't as stiff. Time will only tell how these hold up but from a value standpoint, these are a no brainer as long as you don't mind the lack of Oakley brandingFirst of all, I don't understand why there are no reviews on these AMAZING lenses! They're clear, perfect fit AND over $100 LESS than the same thing offered by Oakley!!! The only thing they don't have is the ""OAKLEY"" name stamped in the top. They are polarized and the lens color is nice, smooth and even. I was expecting something that would make me want to spend $130 on the Oakley lenses. But, instead I got something that makes me want to drop another $30 on more SEEK OPTICS.If money is no object & you just GOTTA have the Oakley name, by all means, drop the extra 100 to get the name. BUT, if clarity, fit, form, function and VALUE are your main concerns... TRY SEEK OPTIC LENSES!!!I doubt you'll be disappointed.I have only wiped these down to clean off my fingerprints after installation. Once I have to give these a good washing a time of 2, I'll update their status. Right now, after having them 1 day & using them in the sun ONCE, I am VERY well pleased in the quality of the Seek Optic Lenses & HIGHLY recommend them to others.Update: 7/22/16I have washed these lenses in plain water, mild soap & water AND had them get blown off of my car onto rocks during a heavy storm. The rocks put a light scratch on the lens & it's unnoticeable unless looking for it. The cleaning hasn't caused any of the coating to degrade & they're in the same condition as day #1... except for the minor scratch mentioned earlier. I stand by my original review & am planning for another lens purchase in the very near future. This time, I may go with the Decepticon purple. I would LOVE to see them make a pair of transition lenses, that way I could use them at work for my safety glasses.These are 20% of the price of the original lenses and the perform just as well. I admit that the finish on the originals just feels a bit better, but these work great. I mostly ride during sunrise and sunset hours and while the Oakley lenses perform flawlessly with no blinding glare these are almost equally as good. If they only last a year I'll still be happy given the price.Fast shipping and Excellent Comunication...There are several features of this lens that make it not as good as original Oakley lenses. The real dealbreaker is the photochromic lens is not clear under low light, and they don't seem to get darker under bright sunlight. They color is like lightly tinted sunglasses, even when the lenses are indoors at night. The polarization differs between the left and right sides, and there is overall distortion. The quality is not so bad that the lens is awful, but if you're expecting something as good as Oakleys, forget it.It is so clear and when it gets dark is still pretty clear and I felt protected !I ordered knockoff Oakley Jawbreakers and this lens to go together. These are the clearest lenses I have ever used and they work very well. Nice and reflective from the front, easy to clean, gorgeous look. Polarized, they reduce glare and reduce eye strain. Well worth the money, just wanted a red/orange option for a second pair.Passgenau in der Jawbreaker, die Polarisierte verfälscht die Farben leider stark.Awesome replacement lenses for oakley jawbreakers. And these wont break the bank. Fits perfectly.Thank you.Very nice lenses, i try it on and its very clear",[]

One thing you do need to take into consideration when taking creatine is that you need to stay well-hydrated since your body will retain more water than before.

This is a brand that you can trust!We use them for our restaurant to properly label everything and they are honestly great labels. From dry goods to being used in our walk In coolers they don’t come apart and are actually so tough that when we go to wash them off it takes forever but that just means it’s doing it’s job.useful productMy labels were perforated after every label or perhaps sometimes you get it perforated after every 12 labels since one of the Avery Answers was just that. It would be nice if that was written somewhere on the product description. I was surprised when they all came perforated after each label after opening the box. It doesn't even say on the outside box. I didn't think it would be a big deal, but I would have chosen not to have them perforated after every 12 label if I had a choice. After using them for a few months, they don't feed correctly in my dot matrix printer and lot of text is misaligned during printing. So apparently it is a big deal.GreatNot much to say about these, they work and they are good. They run perfectly through my old Dot Matrix printer.They're labels, so not too exciting. I wish they could be just a tad wider, as we used it to close big envelopes that have a play kit for children in hospitals. Sometimes they don't always stick as well as they should, so the packets occasionally open in the crates in which we deliver them. However, they are exactly like the ones I used to purchase at Office Depot, but a lot less expensive.Contrary to what most people buy the labels for, I bought them to write the names of cheese in my store and stick them on the surface to display them ..so customers can tell which cheese is which.

The carbide side worked easily and did a great job for the first pass. The ceramic rods do a very nice cleanup of rough edges. I have used the rough/finish all ceramic rods types in the past and find this to be superior to those. I touch up our kitchen and stack knives after each use and am very pleased!I bought this at the recommendation as a friend. I was impressed at how well my friend's sharpened my knives. I bought this to keep in a traveling kit that I take to competitions. It is really good. I wanted one for the house and decided to get the next model up for the house. The Gatco 6224 a bit better than this one. Both sharpeners are better than anything else I have ever used.Just like with the MANY other sharpeners out there, this will touch up your knife when dull. However, this also comes with the carbide blades if you REALLY want to sharpen your knife, or if you need to take out some big nicks. Some won't need the carbide ability, and the other hand sharpeners are perfect for you, but I like the option of being able to really put an edge on my knife, and that's why this rating gets teh 5 stars instead of the 4 of the other types. Great, handy little sharpener.Gatco Double Duty Sharpener was delivered very soon after ordering. Unit appears just as shown and seems to be fo good quality. I tried it on my Italian Stiletto, which is difficult to sharpen and it worked great. This will shortly go in my bug - out bag. I ordered a second one for camping and fishing also. So far very satisfied.Works greatGreat product and value. The sharpener is well made,I’ve owned a ton of quick knife sharpeners and these have worked the best for me by a long shot. A few swipes on even the dullest blade and you’re shaving hair off your arm.This is an amazing tool. I've tried multiple sharpener's in the past at a cost much greater than this tool. Not only did it sharpen our current knives amazingly well, it also resurrected old knives we received as a wedding present 30 years ago! Easy to use with virtually no way to screw up…would recommend this prodcut to anyone who wants an edge.","[""Two precision ground, tungsten carbide blades at preset angles"",""Two fine ceramic rods at preset angles"",""Slip resistant feet and slip resistant gripping pads""]"

The smell was a bit strong as per my liking but one gets used to it. You will get a little burning sensation when you apply for the first time and it takes a while to get rid of pimples (size does decrease overnight). Application is fairly simple. Although it was said that it's highly concentrated, but one can use 1-2 drops of the oil on an ear bud and use it directly. If one really wants to get rid of pimple scars they should definitely use Glyco-6 or Glyco A cream ( readily available on medical stores) on an alternate basis i.e one day with oil and the other day with cream. And lastly, use Himalaya neem fash wash. Trust me, it's the only one that's effective in giving an acne free skin (prolonged usage and patience is necessary).For hair related issues, use it with carrier oil such as coconut oil or any other oil or you can add 7-8 drops to your 200ml shampoo.

"DYMO Standard D1 Labeling Tape for LabelManager Label Makers, Black Print on Blue Tape, 1/2'' W x 23' L, 1 Cartridge (45016)",DYMO,"BLACK PRINT/ BLUE TAPE, 1/2 X 23 BLACK PRINT/ BLUE TAPE, 1/2 X 23","[""Electronics"",""Accessories & Supplies"",""Office Electronics Accessories"",""Labeling Tapes""]",0,,"Print is very legible, and does NOT come off! Good stuff!I don't know if stickiness is improved on another variety of this tape, but this stuff is easy to remove, even if you don't want it to be! :)NASTY adhesive cover on this tiny 1/4"" tape requires a tweezer and magnifying glasses to remove! :(These are great, the cartridges appear to be well made, it's actually a pretty complicated little pack.I use mostly the black on yellow, like this one, due to the contrast. Mostly I use that for labelingDVDs that are now going back into cases again. (I threw hundreds of the old ones away because I wasdriving across country and had zero need to transport all of that. Lots of people throw the entire case andliner away and put these in those carry all disc bags. I really like having them on the shelf, with the title out,displayed individually. I've also used red on white, good stuff too. Along with black on blue, I used that for myblu rays. I'm guessing that it's my relatively new printer that I may have bonked on the side one time, butoccasionally these cartridges will begin printing and then the tape gets stuck as it is feeding and it just getsjammed in there and won't print. You have to open the machine, force out the cart, and then waste several inches of tapeto get it re-aligned, I guess. I don't think I can blame the carts for that.The Labeling Tape is Ok. I found a need for a few different widths. It is amazing how much this makes a difference.The biggest benefit I have with Dymo's tape is that it has printed clearly and consistently - as long as my batteries are in good condition. Weak batteries = poor lettering quality.The biggest drawbacks that I have are 1. the spools are so short (23-feet), 2. the backing is a bit challenging to get peeled if you have short finger nails, and 3. the official Dymo brand 1/4"" width is actually quite expensive. I found a DYMO competitor's tape with a number A43613 to be up to 1/3rd the price. I will be ordering some soon and hope the quality is at least comparable.So why does 23-feet seem short to me? A lot of my labels are 2-3 inches in length, but the label is printed with blank space before and after the printed content so they turn out to be 4-5 inches long. That means I get 2-3 labels per foot on average. So if I use 2 1/2 labels per foot that means I get 57-58 labels per cartridge at cost of ~20 cents each. Since I never know the exact printed length of the labels, sometimes I find myself printing two of them, or even three, to find the right font size to fit the space I have which means I can get a few as ~25 usable labels per cartridge at a cost of about 44 cents each.That is my experience, so the competitor's similar pricing with bulk purchases of 3packs and free shipping seems tantalizing and have them in my in-box to give them a try.So how much can you say about label tapes? The either work or they don't. These labels work very well for my Dymo label maker. I got the label maker and the tapes primarily to label containers that I freeze food in. Prior to this, I was using masking tape. The masking tape worked, but it always left residue that I had to scrape off. These labels stick to the container, but are easily removed without leaving any residue. I also like using the label maker for this task because I can set up a label and print up to 10 at a time. This is so much easier than manually writing on masking tape for the number of labels that I need. I also like that the backing on the labels is easy to remove. The backing is split so that you remove half at a time. This is also so much easier than the old embossed label makers that may or may not leave the little tab to pull off the backing.This product is excellent! The print quality is great, very clear. Just be careful of what sizes refills you buy. The 0.25 (1/4"") will give you a restricted font size. I didn't realize how tinny tiny it would be! 🤷‍♀️ Just a heads up! 👍Enjoy!I find that the label does not stick properly so have to add sticking tap to the edgesThis is good labeling tape. I like the black lettering on white background because it works on everything and I don't have to keep swapping cartridges. The 1/4 inch size has, so far, been perfect for me for labeling everything in sight. The letters are nice and big, easy to read. The ink dries instantly and doesn't run when wet (I tried it). I put these labels on my dry goods containers and I have had no peeling over time (I've had the labels on for a few months), even with the powdered goods like flour, which I use often. The paper backing on the tape is pre-sliced down the center for easy removal, and the glue feels strong.While this item is very useful, and works incredibly well for its given purpose, one MUST know how to properly install it. I managed to waste a lot of Dymo tape because I made the mistake of disarranging the tape. That said, if you manage to install it incorrectly, you can always use the label as a stick-on label. I would always recommend product alignment. If you intend on buying the DYMO LabelWriter 450 (as I did), I would very much recommend using this specific brand of tape.Usual great service and valueGood Colour of black text on light blue film.Perfect for home filing of boring documents etc.Buy the genuine dymo labels, you will always get quality.I really like the results. I didn't find it difficult to switch cartridges at all and so far all the labels made are staying put like they should.Uso mucho el Dymo para marcar cajones y estantes en el taller, así como contenedores y cajas en los closets, así siempre sabes qué tienes dónde. Son un poco caros los carretes, eso sí. La aplicación móvil podría mejorar, pero el material y las etiquetas son excelentes.The printer on the other hand is Fubar. Do not try to put a shortcut to the EXE or paste it to your desktop. The printer will stop working for some reason. Why it changes the EXE on the device I do not know.","[""High quality label maker tape that adheres to plastic, paper, metal, wood, and glass and is ideal for labeling office supplies, electronic accessories, tools, kitchen items, garage equipment, and more"",""Easy-peel, split-back makes separating adhesive labels from tape backing a snap"",""Never needs ink or toner: labels are created using thermal transfer printing"",""Label tape is water resistant and withstands exposure to sunlight without fading or peeling"",""For use with most DYMO label makers, including LMPC II, LM350, LP350, LM260P, LM450, LM210D, LM120P, LM220P, LM155, LM150, LP250, DUO, LM160, LM280, LM360D, LM420P, LM450D, LM500TS, LMPnP (label makers sold separately)""]"

JBL Charge 4 - Waterproof Portable Bluetooth Speaker - Black,JBL,"Introducing the JBL charge 4 portable Bluetooth speaker with full-spectrum powerful sound and a built-in power bank to charge your devices It Features a proprietary developed driver and two JBL bass radiators that intensify sound with strong deep bass Its high-capacity 7500mAh rechargeable li-ion battery provides up to 20 hours of playtime The speaker carries a convenient USB charge out to quickly charge your devices such as your smartphone so you will never run out of power again The charge 4 features a rugged design IPX7 waterproof rated exterior and comes in a suite of cool colors Together with JBL connect+ it can wirelessly link more than 100 JBL connect+ enabled speakers to elevate your listening experience. Troubleshooting Tips:1. Make sure that before use, customers are fully charging the battery. There is an included USB-C cable for charging that is in the accessory pack along with the quick start guide2. Please make sure customers have the latest software and version of Bluetooth downloaded to their device3. Bluetooth performance and connectivity can vary based on the environment in which it is being used. For best performance make sure that there is minimal interference (doors, walls, etc) between this speaker and the device transmitting Bluetooth4. On the back of the speaker there is a USB-A connection that customers can connect their device to in order to use the CHARGE4 as battery. This would be the charging port5. Quick Start Guide attached for your reference","[""Electronics"",""Portable Audio & Video"",""Portable Speakers & Docks"",""Portable Bluetooth Speakers""]",JBL,,"Unlike most people who use speakers like this for fun, I used it for work. As a FedEx Express courier, not only did our bigger trucks not have working climate controls, arm rests, cruise control, or insulation from the elements, we don't have speakers! Imagine hours on the road in a loud tin can shaking and rattling every which way with no music to soothe your stress!So one night I decided, no more of that. This speaker fit right into the passengers ""seat"", and I would strap the seatbelt just incase (the trucks had world class terrible suspension, the smallest bump in the road would send anything not strapped down flying).With that, at full volume in the truck that battery might last around 4 or 5 hours. But man oh man on full volume it would tune out the road noise, tin can truck doors rattling against the metal body, everything. It made my driving experience so much better. That being said, I would only need full volume on the highway (did you know Express trucks are governed to 65mph? Well, assuming our trucks could even easily reach that. At least in my station they all had check engine lights and I once timed that it took 27 seconds to go from 40mph to 65mph. Fun!) and when I was driving from 30-50mph having the speaker at ~70% was fine. At that rate I could make it last about 8 hours before needing a recharge.I thank JBL for creating such a great speaker and frankly I am sure their other products have that battery capacity I needed, but I got this on sale and it fit right into my backpack. For the situation I was in, it was a total game changer. I went from messy stressy anger to happily singing along to my favorite songs. On the off-chance another courier reads this, making it your routine to turn the speaker off on your way out the door will save battery. I will have fond memories of driving down my route playing music and singing my heart out for those precious few moments where the stress was pushed to the back of my mind.Luckily I do not work there anymore and this speaker will not see daily use, but when I needed it, my life was much better for it. It sat next to an open door in an Isuzu Reach and never moved a centimeter, providing me with amazing sound all the while. I know now anything and everything I might throw at it will never take it down. If battery life is your concern, it is valid. If you want the best sound for the size of the speaker, this is hard to beat, and it has my ""doing deliveries in a tin can with an open door on a road at 45mph still sounding good"" seal of approval!I was debating between the JBL charge 4 and a different version of the JBL and I’m so glad I went with this one! The sounds quality is amazing and it came packaged so nicely. JBL speakers on Amazon go on sale frequently so add it to your cart and wait for the price to drop! The quality is amazing and it’s so load for how small it is. This one doesn’t come with a case or carrier or anything but it is made out of such nice quality I haven’t had any issues or scratches and I’ve just been throwing it in a tote bag! The charging port for your phone is so nice too, and chargers relatively fast. If you’re debating between this one and a pricier one I would go with the Charge 4!Not into the latest commercial fads but I am very impressed by these radios. The size and sound is about the same as a high end radio. This streaming radio has an unlimited operating range along with solving many of the problems associated with ""bad reception"". Truly a revolutionary breakthrough for the still strong radio listening audience. Living in NYC I am now able to clearly listen to one of my favorite radio stations from Massachusetts along with one in my area that has a weak signal. I love its portability along with its apparently long rechargeable battery life. Have listened to higher rated more costly products of the same size but honestly hear very little difference. I own a much higher end, powerful, stereo system for a more engaging musical experience. A well designed, water resistant, portable unit that can be used at home or outdoors. Have fun finding some of your out of area (online) radio stations and enjoy this wonderful new technology...I had this model on hold for a long while as I searched for the best all around speaker for my 14 year old sons bday. This thing is awesome! Sound is crisp and clear. And no vibration or sound distortion at the highest level. From Rap to Reggaton this speaker is awesome. JBL is an old U.S. brand and still putting out a great product. Even the color design is solid without peeling. I have two more on my list for Christmas for my other son and my husband. I definitely recommend buying the case. This does come with a USB ""C"" type cord but no charging block to plug into the wall. This is also a charger and has an On/Off button. Volume is controlled by Bluetooth on smart phone. Instant change between songs without skipping or hesitation. Make sure you look all yhrough the box so you don't accidentally throw the cord out.No escribo reseñas habitualmente, pero esta vez creo que es necesario, quizá hasta pueda hacer que alguno de ustedes no la compre...Me explico:He tenido una JBL Flip 4 durante los últimos 10 meses y he estado contento con ella, hasta hace un par de semanas en que decidí que era momento de otra bocina portátil: con buena calidad de sonido pero un poco más potente. Me puse a investigar que modelos podrían servirme y la lista de bocinas en éste rango de precios parece interminable, por ejemplo: Bosé Soundlink Mini II, Beats Pill+, Sony XB31, Marshall Stockwell, etc. Acudí a las sucursales de Bestbuy y Costco de mi localidad para probar cada una de ellas. La que más me convenció de éstas fue la Bosé Soundlink Mini II, porque creo que está bastante equilibrada, pero aún siento que le falta potencia y está un poco inflada de precio.Fue entonces cuando recordé que hace algún tiempo había tenido oportunidad de probar una JBL Charge 3 y me sorprendió bastante (de manera positiva). A final de cuentas la decisión quedó entre la Bosé Soundlink Mini II y la JBL Charge, opté por esta última.Al llegar a la tienda de Bestbuy de mí localidad los modelos de Charge 3 habían sido descontinuados y liquidados hacia un par de meses y acababa de llegar el nuevo modelo: la JBL Charge 4. Desafortunadamente todavía no la tenían instalada para realizar una prueba de audio, pero en ese momento pensé: “si la otra ya era buena, esta debe ser mejor”!!!.Me fijé en el precio... en Bestbuy cuesta cerca de 4000 pesos. Chequé el precio en Amazon y en ese momento estaba en 3199... ahora está en 2800 (parece una ganga, pero ojo, todavía no termino de explicar).... Antes de comprarla decidí ver diferentes opiniones de ""expertos"" (personas) que la habían probado antes en YouTube...Llegue a casa y vi todas las reviews qué hay en YouTube sobre la Charge 4 (literalmente), así como las de un tal Clavinetjunkie (algo así) que me parece el menos sesgado y con una opinión más profesional, con menos marketing.Para resumir: Todas las reviews de JBL Charge 4 exaltaban las bondades de esta bocina: es 10 W más potente, se carga con USB tipo C, que tiene más batería (7600 mAh), más tiempo las actualizaciones vía OTA, etc.Sin embargo, si se fijan casi nadie la recomienda por encima de la Charge 3 por una razón: es Monoaural.Todas esas reviews que les comento mencionan que el hecho de que la bocina sea monoaural no compromete la calidad del audio y que a final de cuentas el 90% de los usuarios estarán contentos con ella.Entonces.... lo sé, la regué: Compré la bocina sin probarla previamente!!! la compré por Amazon por el costo (3199 pesos). Llegó, la recibí en el trabajo... un par de compañeros que la escucharon apenas salió de la caja estuvieron contentos con el sonido. Sin embargo a mí no me convencía... no sabía por qué.... pero en ese momento supe que soy parte del 10% restante.Al llegar a casa y poner la música que consigue muy buenos efectos en modo estereo (ahora se me ocurre 99 red Balloons de Nena, What a Fool Believes, Shoot to thrill de AC/DC, etc) no conseguía encontrar los detalles del sonido. No me malinterpreten, la bocina consigue crear un buen “soundstage”, el bajo/medios/agudos me parecen equilibrados, a pesar de tener la preEQ de JBL, es solo que al interpretar todo a través de un solo canal de audio se pierden todos esos detalles que disfruto de la música... suena como el radio de la cocina de mi abuelita (lo notarán al compararla con otra en modo estéreo).En fin...Fue tanta mi decepción que decidí regresarla y comprar la JBL Charge 3 ó la Bosé Soundlink Mini II en su lugar. Por ahora no tengo conflicto con ninguna de éstas de pensar en cargarlas con un microUSB (a pesar de que el Galaxy S9 sólo tenga tipo C) o el tener una menor cantidad de batería, si con ello consigo el sonido que me gusta.Creo que JBL trato de disminuir costos y obtener más ganancias en esta edición de Charge (esto se puede ver porque le quitaron hasta el micrófono, que podría ser de utilidad para tomar una llamada urgente si estas en una alberca, o lejos de tu teléfono).Ojalá la Charge 5 mejore estos aspectos... no siempre lo más nuevo es mejor.Espero te haya sido de utilidad.The charge 4 comes in at a larger size than its predecessor the charge 3, mainly due to the increased battery size.The sound is tuned more towards the mid /highs and is lacking bass.I've spent the last 3 days doing side by side comparisons with my charge 3, and my conclusion is while the charge 4 does have larger battery for charging your phone, the lack of bass and larger size make the charge 4 underwhelming. If you find the charge 3 on sale for $139 or under pick that up instead! It is still the gold standard!The sound is really crisp and bright in the middle ranges. The high frequency response definitely attenuates. The bass really lacks between 60 to 90 hz where the sound effectively cuts off entirely at around 70 hz (regardless if using bass boost). Electronic music with sub 60 hz literally cuts off. The speaker is rated for 60 hz so I can't knock them off for something I agreed to buy.Aesthetically, the device looks and feels excellent. I look forward to making use of it.All in all, the device is good but I would say you are paying more than what you get. Then again portable speaker sound quality is inherently gimped so you can't expect to get the same quality for the same price as another type of sound system.The JBL Charge 4 is, in my opinion, the best of its class for size, battery life, sound quality, and build. It's not too big at all; perfect size can easily carry it in your hand or a backpack without any problems. The advertised battery life of 20 hours is valid and lasts me a week or more depending on use and volume; it also charges up pretty fast and can be used as a power bank to charge other devices. The sound quality is astonishing. It provides plenty of base, clarity in mids and highs, as well as a lot of volumes, e.g., can fill my house will sound without breaking a sweat. In my opinion, it far surpasses the likes of its competitors like the UE Boom 3, JBL Flip 5, Sony XB32, etc... The build quality and aesthetics are also gorgeous. The mesh material on the outside provides a premium look and feel while protecting the speaker as well, given its IPX7 waterproof rating. If you are looking for a portable, premium sounding, Bluetooth speaker, I would highly recommend purchasing this. The only reason I would consider something like the UE Boom 3 or JBL Flip 5 is if you really really need it to be portable. Because the JBL Charge 4 is quite portable and provides much better sound quality and battery life, which makes it worth the extra money.Es una muy chula bocina, he tenido 3 bocinas de gama baja por asi decirlo. La primera fue una JBL GO monoaural, para el tamaño era buena, solo que no tenia nada de graves. La otra fue un regalo era una Perfect Choice de 10w Stereo y no me termino de convencer su sonido. Despues tuve una Philips Monoaural de 10w y suena bien, solo que le hacia falta mas graves y la bateria se quedaba muy corta, y ahora me decidi invertir en algo mas. Tenia ganas de una Sony por las luces, pero mucha gente decia que cuando llegaba a bateria baja se le bajaba el volumen y detalles asi, y no me terminaron de convencer. Luego aparecio esta bestia (no estaba acostumbrado a bocinas grandes) y solo dije: WOW! Se escucha muy bien, no hay distorsion, tiene un volumen muy bueno y tiene unos bajos excelentes. Mucha gente se queja de que es Monoaural, pero siento que no es muy importante en una bocina portatil, fuera sonido 360° pues ahi si me lo pienso, pero yo prefiero mas calidad de sonido que el efecto Stereo, y no decepciona en nada. Ecualizando la musica le vas a sacar mas provecho a los graves, solo que toma en cuenta que disminuiras el volumen en un 20 o 30% aumentando graves. Estoy muy contento con esta bocina, JBL no decepciona. No hay distorsion y su bateria me ha llegado a durar de 12 a 14 horas a volumen medio con graves.

Streak Free Residue Free Qty: 30 Sheets Read more","[""Health & Household"",""Household Supplies"",""Laundry"",""Laundry Detergent"",""Liquid Detergent""]",‏  ‎ Sheets Laundry Club,,"I did a lot of research in choosing a solid laundry detergent option to find these. The reviews are convincing enough, but I didn't really know what to expect as I've really only used liquid detergents before. However, I have been trying to find ways to cut out plastic use to the best of my abilities and this seemed like an easy and logical step to take. Scents have also been irritating my sinuses and asthma a lot these days, so I wanted to find something that was scent free but still left things feeling fresh. So, I ordered these and decided to see what happened.I've been using them now for a couple of months. They last WAY longer than liquid detergent, take up way less space in my very small apartment, and my clothes come out feeling clean and fresh every single time. There's almost no difference to the clean feel that I got from liquid detergents. My sinuses and asthma problems have been better after making the switch to these, also. Might be unrelated, but it feels related enough as I haven't changed much else.Finally, it just feels really good using a product that works very well and also reduces my waste. I highly recommend these to anyone who is looking to just take a simple step in reducing their eco-footprint or just wants to try something a little more allergy friendly. I'm going to continue to buy and use these for as long as I am able.These are fantastic. Simple as can be. Just toss part of a sheet in with your laundry (I just toss mine right on top of my load) and you're done.And economical. I compared the price when I bought them to the liquid detergent I had been using and it was no contest at all. I did find some cheaper powder options, but not by as much as I would have expected. These were clearly on the low end of the spectrum and for me the effectiveness, simplicity and lack of mess mean they more than pay for themselves. You'll find lower cost options but I can't imagine feeling like these are exorbitant.One of the greatest things is the flexibility. The sheets are sized according to the most detergent you're likely to need in any load. I end up using half a sheet for normal loads, a quarter sheet for small loads, and 3/4 for really big loads or just a little extra oomph. I don't think I've ever used a full sheet; you'll get far more loads out of these than there are sheets.I find them perfectly effective, performing on par with other detergents we've used. Laundry needs at our house are pretty basic. Our clothes get lived in before we wash, but we don't deal with a ton of major stains and odors constantly. I've got some everyday stains out with these alone. I've paired these with regular bleach and had good results, so I reckon you could use other additives with them just fine. But check out some other reviews if you think you need something heavier-duty than I've needed these for, or if you have particular sensitivities.Another thing worth noting, I've had bad luck with powder in general in the past, with it not dissolving properly, especially in cold water; which is a small majority of my laundry. For our basic uses, these seem to dissolve no problem. I've never found any residue or anything either in the washer afterward or on any clothes.Past that, I've found storage and tidiness are side benefits. This tiny box as opposed to a huge tub? Yes please. The cardboard isn't so strong you'll reuse the box after, but it's as sturdy as it needs to be and the ""drawer"" design lets you save partial sheets on top of the stack for next time. Neat as a pin, with no drips or grains to wipe up after. Keep it high enough that nothing wet will spill on it and give your shelf some breathing room.What else... fresh scent that's not overly strong, obviously all the ecological and sustainability benefits... I may tinker around with other laundry options when it's time to replace these just to experiment but these set a high bar for our needs.I have been using these laundry sheets for about a year now and I like that there is no plastic jug to fill the landfill with. The laundry sheets are meant to be cut in half for a full load but if I have a very small load I can cut into smaller pieces and they are much more economical that say a laundry pod. The plastic pods did not dissolve well but these laundry sheets leave no residue behind even after washing in cold water. I have even convinced my budget savvy daughter to buy laundry sheets. We have been on vacation a few times now and the laundry sheets are so easy to pack in the suitcase. I am about to order again the Fresh Linen scent. I have a sensitive nose and cannot tolerate strong perfumes but the linen scent is very mild.I had to stop using pods because I kept finding partially dissolved pods in the laundry after the cycle. I don't have that problem with the sheets. It's also a small box, rather than a big jug.Recently, my son in law was talking about one of the kids getting rashes on his back. I had a box I hadn't opened yet, so I gave it to them. As far as I know, problem solved. Unscented is a good thing.I'm not a fan of the plastic jugs but the laundry sheet manufacturers aren't the solution. I should have crunched the numbers before I bought the laundry sheets.We've had the solution for generations.Name brand powdered laundry detergents which have been dermatologist tested, are biodegradable, come in cardboard packaging, and are priced considerably less.50 loads (100 if you rip them in half for small loads) or Name brand 137oz/172 (HEC compatible) loads for the same amount of money.Overall, product worked well. Would only recommend for travelling purposes though.I got these after watching a documentary about how the planet is dying. I panicked and bought a bunch of eco-friendly house products. I figured I would give it a shot but i doubted these sheets could work like my Tide which I have used my entire life. Well well well....let me tell you. I was shocked when they came out of the dryer and my clothes felt luxurious. Super soft with no fabric softener. The scented ones don't Stay scented through the dryer so the lack of scent is something to get used to. But may try their scent booster. My towels felt fluffier so naturally like a crazy lady I ran upstairs and compared it to a towel I washed with tide. And they are actually softer and visibly fluffier. This is so cool. A product that is made in the USA, eco friendly AND is actually superior to my other brand. I am impressed.","[""Your clothes will love sheets - we made this liquid free detergent sheet to soften and reduce wrinkles and eliminate odors, stains, and dirt.

It is more lightweight and would be a nicer blanket to use in the summer. The only reason I mention the color is because I am using it on a daybed in my great room, which can be used as a couch or a bed. The queen size fits my twin bed much better than the twin size, which did not cover my dust ruffle like I needed it to in the front of it. Unfortunately the dust ruffle I have is too light of a brown, but it matches the three pillows perfectly on the daybed. So now I will have to replace the dust ruffle.

They were very professional, and their customer service is excellent. They researched the issue with their engineers and said there was an issue with the design where the power buttons would get pressed while in the storage case. They said they were already working on changing to an improved design to eliminate this problem within a month.They offered to send me a replacement product, which they sent to me free of charge. The replacement product, while not exactly the same as the original unit (lacking the air compressor function) is actually very nice and works great so far. I am confident that YABER will continue to improve their designs and their overall offering.

This is very important to us, thank you in advance!Sincerely!YABER customer service team""Original Review (2/5 stars):I was almost going to give this 5 stars (maybe 4) but then I went to use this thing only for the flood light while working on the roof of my RV in the dark, and lo and behold, the 83% charge the unit had the day before was down to 0%. Prior to this, the unit would say 100% even after a jump, so perhaps the battery monitor system was not reporting accurately and the real percentage was lower than stated, but I couldn't be bothered to do a bunch of tests with only a couple days left in the return window, and much more pressing projects needing to be done (hence working in the dark late at night).The only complaint I had before this was the need to usually re-hook the jumper cables to the battery to get the unit to register and start its internal jump protocol (essentially, just turning off the safety feature and allowing the battery to power the jumper cables, if I understand correctly). Sometimes this needed to be done two or three times to get the Yaber to do its thing, but once it recognized the battery and activated, my Toyota Sequoia with its large battery and engine turned over no problem. If the battery had managed to hold a charge for a reasonable amount of time, I would have definitely kept this unit. I didn't even get to test the air compressor yet, but I was eager to find out if it could really put out the 150PSI and fill my 120 PSI RV tires. Oh well! Maybe others will have better luck, but I didn't have time to monkey around.Original Post:Never even got to try it, as the only time the display would turn on was if the USB was plugged into a charger (not included) and it would just sit at 0% charging. Manual states that at least a USB-A 5V 2A is needed to charge and fortunately I had several laying around the house but they all yield the same result, no charging.UPDATED:Yaber saw my review and even though I had returned the original Yaber YA30, they insisted on making things right and offered to send me a different unit. I accepted and they sent me the Yaber YR800 which is a smaller unit with similar jump start specifications but without the tire inflator. I have tried it several times mainly with smaller vehicles like a moped but did disconnect the battery on my RAM 2500 HEMI 6.4L and had no issue starting it. This unit doesn't have the protruding power button that's prone to battery drain during shipping or storage (if depressed) like the YA30. They did inform me that the YA30 is due to be redesigned to address the issue and I look forward to getting it when it is.Conclusion:Although the original item purchased does not meet my conditions for a 4-star review, the care and customer support from Yaber should be more than enough to instill confidence in the brand and the fact that they stand behind their products and truly appreciate their customers.The product was smaller than I thought and comes with a nice case. For charging you can use the included USB C to A cable but it doesn't come with a power brick. I used my laptops charger but it wasn't the fastest. The two USB charging ports on the device charge at different rates, with the top port showing 7w on the display and the bottom showing 5w. I'm not sure if this is actual wattage though because when the air pump is being used it shows 99w, so maybe it's a percentage of total power.I am a fan of the air compressor feature. You can easily present the pressure you want and then just press the Air button and it will automatically pump air until the pressure is reached. Also the air line is long enough to reach the top of my tire on my Subaru Crosstrek! I could definitely see it being too short to reach the top of a larger cars tire, but it's easy enough to just pick up while it automatically pumps.. the product also include 3 different air pump tips so you can inflate a ball or whatever else too. Oh yeah and it's pretty loud while pumping air.For the battery, it charged half of my phone battery with 25% of it's own battery. I wish it had a 9v output instead of the DC, but that's just me. Last, the light is nice a bright and can rotate all the way around and drains the battery very slowly so you can keep it on for a long time.When I recieved the Yaber jump starter the manual says to use a 5v/2a adapter with the provided cord… the original didn’t charge from the moment it was delivered……the seller made things right by sending another model and it works great. It was delivered within 2 days after contacting the seller.I would like to thank them for there quick action in making it right.This car charging kit is great. So far, I have tried the light and used the air compressor. The light is bright and I love that it's rotatable. The compressor worked like a charm on my mid size SUV tire. The manual advises to allow the charger to rest after using it for so long. Please do. Just with filling one tire from 26 PSI to 44 PSI, the compressor cord got very, very warm to the touch. I let it cool before storing. As for the other features, hopefully they work just as well when needed. A good buy.Unit even warned me i crossed the positive and negative connection because the battery terminal are not color coded in my car. And after jump starting the car with battery thats been dead a week it started the first try. Then i put air in the tire and still had 80% power left. It's a good purchase.Got used one that the air compressor didn't work instead of new one . And didn't got the manual this shows that the unit used . The 4 stars are for the costumer service .J'habite à la montagne, et il arrive régulièrement que ma batterie se décharge plus rapidement qu'elle ne devrait. Et avec le confinement, le télétravail, ... ma Peugeot 208 roule beaucoup moins qu'auparavant, cela n'a pas aidé non plus vous vous en doutez ! On n'a pas toujours des câbles sous la main et un bon samaritain pour nous aider, je me suis donc dit qu'il était temps d'investir dans un booster de batterie qui répondrait à ce besoin, et qui en plus me permettrait de charger mes appareils (mobiles, tablettes, ...) lors des voyages.J'ai donc longuement hésité avant de réaliser mon achat de booster de batterie tellement il existe de modèles différents (puissance, taille, fonctionnalités). Après vérification des puissances proposées, lecture des différents commentaires et visionnages de plusieurs vidéos postées sur internet par des consommateurs, je me suis décidée à acheter celui de Yaber [modèle 1000A 13800mAh Booster Batterie Voiture Moto (Jusqu'à 6.0L Essence 5.0L Gazole)], et je ne regrette absolument pas mon achat. Celui-ci répond à ses promesses, il ne prend pas de place et il est fourni avec différents câbles et une pochette de transport ! Le rapport qualité prix est parfait et la livraison a été rapide et soignée.Dans les faits, Yaber vous recommande de le charger complétement avant sa première utilisation : cela m'a pris à peu près 1h00 via un port de charge rapide (USB SS) sur mon ordinateur. J'ai ensuite branché le Yaber sur ma batterie en suivant les instructions du manuel (traduit en plusieurs langues). Ma voiture a démarré du premier coup, puis s'est ré éteinte: la batterie était vraiment très faible). J'ai alors activé le mode ""forçage"" du booster (un petit bouton prévu à cet effet ) et là nickel, ça a fonctionné sans problème. J'ai démarré ma Peugeot 208 dont la batterie était quasiment à plat grâce au Yaber en a peine 2 minutes ( en tenant compte du premier essai ) et le booster a toujours la batterie pleine (un système de leds indique le niveau de charge du booster).Je valide cet investissement que je ne regrette absolument pas et je le recommande vivement à tous ceux qui comme moi vivraient une situation similaire.Permet de faire démarrer ma BMW 120D lorsque la batterie est à plat, mais aussi en cas de forte baisse de température où elle a du mal à démarrer (en attendant de changer de batterie, car elle fonctionne bien en température au dessus de 0).Ce booster, chargé à 100% permet de faire plusieurs démarrages avant qu'il n'arrive à 50% (deux LED sur 4 qui s'allument). Il est vivement conseillé de ne pas l'utiliser comme booster en dessous de 50% de capacité.Le chargement possible par USB-C permet une recharge plus rapide. Je ne l'utilise guère comme Powerbank même si cette fonctionnalité est pratique et peut s'avérer être utile, mais je ne saurais dire si la capacité réelle correspond à celle annoncée.Bien plus pratique qu'un câble de démarrage qui nécessite une âme charitable et parfois des manoeuvres compliquées voire impossible pour suffisamment rapprocher les deux voitures.Le seul ""bémol"" est que je dois systématiquement activer le bouton ""forçage"" pour que cela fonctionne, le branchement seul + allumage de la Powebank n'a aucun effet sur le démarrage.Bonjour , Je vient d'acquérir votre produit avec je voie des note pour la plupart des commentaires positif donc j'ai acheter votre produit qui me semblais magique hors quans je l'ai reçue un simple utilitaire berlingot auquel sa batterie étais fatiguer et il n'a pas pu le démarrer je compter sur lui hors il nous a laisser dans l'ambarra en attendant la dépanneuse je suis super déçue de votre produit c'est la première fois que j'achète un produit chez vous mais je pense que sa sera la dernière ,Merci de pouvoir faire quelque chose pour moi merciTesté ce week-end sur la Golf (moteur essence), batterie à plat après 6 semaines sans sortir la voiture, même le verrouillage centralisé était mort.Démarré avec le forçage les 2 fois où j'ai démarré avec (une à l'aller et une au retour du supermarché, avant de faire un trajet suffisant pour recharger la batterie). Il reste encore largement de quoi relancer encore au moins une à deux fois (même si le manuel conseille de ne tenter de démarrage qu'avec 3 à 4 voyants allumés sur 4).Les câbles fournis sont nickels en USB C et micro-USB (mais pour recharger le booster j'utilise le câble USB C de mon mobile, plus long). Plutôt utiles pour un usage de batterie externe, mais perso j'évite de tirer sur la batterie hors usage de booster, au risque de se trouver en rade pour cet usage principal.La dragonne de la boîte est très fragile et a rompu presque immédiatement, donc évitez de te la tenir par là. De toute façon elle a peu d'intérêt, donc pas de dégradation de note uniquement pour ça.La boîte elle est bien solide et le booster est bien calé dans une mousse.Franchement allez- les yeux fermés, et ceci n'est pas un avis de testeur ""professionnel"" qui reçoit gratuitement des produits et réductions (genre ""club des testeurs""...) contre des avis positifs !Acheté pour démarrer une voiture qui commence à avoir des problèmes de batterie quand elle n'a pas été démarrée depuis longtemps.

We outgrew the storage we previously had, and wanted something with more room and furniture-y looking. After shopping around, Amazon had the best price, so I snapped two up.Fedex left the packages in front of our garage in the very early morning, and I managed to get them shoved inside and left to ward off porch pirates, although they'd need to be strong in this case to steal the packages.The parts were well protected in layers of styrofoam and wrap, and it took us about 15 minutes to unpack and account for all the parts.Once we'd accounted for all pieces, we started assembly. The directions were clear enough for flat pack, and this wasn't our first rodeo. It took around an hour and 15 minutes to get the first one put together, because we got the two side panels flipped, and discovered that when we tried to put the top on. The second unit we were able to get put together in about 45 minutes. As other reviewers have mentioned, the cam locks and bolt dealies are pretty flimsy, so that's not great. But we didn't have any issues assembling. We did keep the extra pieces Crosley sent, just in case.So far, we are pleased with the amount of storage these units have. I've got a full flatware service for 12 in one drawer (we did buy drawer dividers), cloth napkins in another, hydroponic garden supplies in the other unit, and the last drawer is currently open.We did place both wine dividers in the units, I've got white wines in one and red in the other.The main thing I'm pleased about is that I've got all my hardcover cookbooks in the bottom side spaces (behind the doors on either side) after a culling of unused/uneeded books. So far, they are bearing the weight with no ill effects. I tried to split up the cookbooks so that each side got an equal weight. Lighter cookbooks are stacked on the shelf behind the door - need to sort those out yet. But so far, the shelf is sturdy and has had no issue supporting the books. On the top of one unit, we've parked our ice machine and our Victrola. On the other unit, we've got our hydroponic gardens.

Non-toxic.,"[""Arts, Crafts & Sewing"",""Crafting"",""Craft Supplies"",""Glitter""]",Sulyn,"Arts, Crafts & Sewing","I got this glitter to use for a ""chill out"" jar for my toddler. If you're into toddler crafts, basically it's a jar that you fill with water, glue, food coloring, glitter, and corn syrup. The glitter moves about as the toddler moves the jar. It's supposed to not only be memorizing, but it's also supposed to help them calm down--or ""chill out.""For my craft, I needed a good weight to my glitter. In stores, I'd found small (and expensive) jars of glitter that I worried wouldn't have the right weight to float up and down. I didn't want just a clump of glitter--the weight needed to be substantial, if that makes sense.I found this jar and was happy with the price (who knew glitter was so expensive?!) and the little particles looked to be about the right size.All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase. While the jar is relatively small when you have two glitter-loving toddler girls, it's definitely the right weight for my chill out jar project. The particles are slightly under a millimeter in diameter, which is on the larger side for glitter. This is definitely a type of good-quality glitter that I remember from my childhood...not the tiny stuff that I keep seeing all over the place.I took a photo to give you a better idea of the size.

It would be nice if the packet came with an extra screw in each size.  My only other suggestion might be for Closet Maid to pre-stamp each piece with the ""name"" it is given in the instructions - especially in light of the fact that some boards are the same size, but have a different pattern of pre-drilled holes.  You can see what I mean, below.I am a smart woman.  People even tell me that, sometimes.  Most don't know that I am terrible at ""spatial ability"" - I can't figure out how to put things (like puzzles) together very well.  My brain just doesn't see that way.  But today I un-boxed the shelving unit (some assembly required) I ordered in a fit of over-confidence while surfing the web at 2 a.m. a few weeks ago.I gathered my tools - a screwdriver and a hammer, just like the instructions told me to.  I reviewed how many of every screw there was, and what they were called (""assembly"" screw, that's an ""assembly"" screw -- I would even say it out loud to reinforce the concept).  I counted the pre-cut, pre-drilled boards and stacked them neatly into piles by size.I bribed the 9 year-old to help gramma, and he did so willingly, at first.  I got the side board connected to the top board, (or maybe it was the bottom board) and was feeling fairly proud of myself.  But the instructions called for me to fit ""short dowels"" into pre-drilled holes in the top board (or maybe it was the bottom board).  But the stupid dowels wouldn't fit!  So I pulled out the instructions and realized I had picked up a horizontal divider when what I needed was a fixed shelf (same size but the dowels would fit into this one - who knew!).So I unscrewed the first two boards, and grabbed a post-it notepad and labeled ALL the boards - just in case.  I had the 9-year old help me again hold the boards while I reattached the fixed shelf to the side board (or maybe it was a top board).  Once again, when it came time to screw the top board (or maybe bottom?) to the vertical board, I realized there was no pre-drilled hole!  The 9-year old had the best view (and better vision) and noticed immediately that the pre-drilled hole was on the wrong side.  So we detached the screws (again) and turned the board around (I was so sure I had it right this time, too.) And the re-screwing was far quicker.  But... you guessed it, I had the finished side (only one of the four sides was finished) pointing the wrong direction... so we backtracked.  Again.Eventually, the 9-year old wandered off to play with his brother.  He told me I should be more careful.  Duly noted. And I urged him to keep that play appointment in the other room - pronto.  So, with careful re-reading of the instructions (in three languages!) and diligence with the post-it notes (that kept sliding off the slick finish), I continued to assemble the shelf-unit.  With only one near amputation when the ""real wood!"" board (probably that stupid fixed shelf, or maybe it was the vertical divider) slid out of my grip and landed faint millimeters from my toe.  That board was heavy, too! It even shook the house! Of course it did.Anyway, I counted and there were precisely eighteen ""assembly screws"" and not one more and not one less.  I guarded them with my life, counting before and after every potty break and coffee run.  Finally, with the unit mostly assembled, I came to the ""backing"" (which turned out to be a folded piece of cardboard-hey, what happened to the ""real wood""?).  And it turned out, there were only three, despite the fact there were six openings.  And now you know my sense of ""style"" is as absent as my spatial ability.  Covering only three of the six squares provides a unique ""look"" - at least to all non-OCD customers. Nevertheless, I persisted.Each piece of folded cardboard was nailed down with, I kid you not, 12 teeny pin-like nails, called ""nails"" in the instructions (Ciou, Ciavo, Nail - that whole 3 languages thing).  And these things were designed by an absolute 4-star genius.  Imagine the amount of research it must have taken to size these pins to the exact the depth of my thumb! I was in awe.  Because that precision measurement resulted in me not being able to even ""start"" the nail without slamming into my thumb.  Thirty-six times, if you don't count all the ones that fell out before I could get the nail stabilized.  I checked for ""hacks to avoid hitting your thumb"" on my phone, after only five or six nails (I told you I was smart) and discovered that you can hold a nail between the teeth of your comb (or your husband's comb, if he is not at home).  Bonus, as you are pounding the bejabbers out of everything in the vicinity of your microscopic nail-pin, the comb appears to act as a protective agent for the shelf (or maybe it was the horizontal divider).  The comb, however, did turn out to be mostly a total loss.But I did it.  I assembled a ""some assembly required"" shelving unit and it only took me six hours.PS - you may need ice for the finger you forgot to move during the flailing/so-called hammering you did prior to the comb hack.PPS - and save the ice because it turns out that all those boards nailed together are far heavier than the single board that missed your toe earlier.Enjoy!","[""CUBE ORGANIZER 4-Cube design with four square, cube openings for horizontal or vertical display orientation"",""CUBE STORAGE UNIT Create storage and display space for any living area in your home for books, garments, décor, picture frames or keepsakes; Ideal for trendy organization with 2 back panels"",""STACKING DESIGN Hardware included for easy stacking of multiple units (sold separately)"",""ADD FABRIC DRAWERS Add on compatible 11 in. fabric cube drawers to add in color & style; Cube compartments measure 11.25 in.

Amprobe AM-510 Commercial/Residential Multimeter with Non-Contact Voltage Detection,Amprobe,"Amprobe products range from an extensive line of clamp meters and digital multimeters to industry-specific tools for residential/commercial electricians, HVAC/R technicians, utilities and industrial maintenance professionals. All Amprobe tools undergo rigorous testing to ensure full compliance with the latest IEC and CE safety regulations in Fluke Safety labs for quality and safety you can trust.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Electrical"",""Testers"",""Multi Testers""]",‏  ‎ Amprobe,‏  ‎ Unisex Adult,"This is a good DMM for the money. House hold use, testing outlets, etc. Wanted a safe meter, see Youtube videos for a guy who zaps it with kilovolts. This meter came out second best to a Fluke. Plenty accurate for my use. Amprobe is owned by Fluke and is tested in Fluke labs. The only negative are the leads. When I measured the resistance of the leads the readings jumped all over the place. I tried cleaning with papertowel and isopropyl alcohol no help. Then I used a very fine abrasive pad with alcohol, now the resistance is zero. Also made the continuity function much quicker and consistent. Must be corrosion or some kind of coating on the probes. Many choices for DMMs in the sub $50 range. Almost bought a Fluke 101 $44. This meter has more features, current, loaded battery tester, NCV, relative, backlight and stand, rubbery case. The Fluke is true RMS, has a stronger plastic case and is more compact. I think I made the right choice. P.S. I have a Fluke 115 but wanted a cheaper meter for less exacting tasks.I used a basic multimeter from Craftsman for years. I use these for electronics hobbies that need a bit more detail than the basics but without needing the full functionality of a Fluke as we have in my work lab. Excellent balance of price and features.Price point is excellent / accurate / great featuresI did a lot of research on multimeters before choosing to order this one from Amprobe. For the balance of price and features from a reputable manufacturer, this is a decent product. I chose Amprobe over the many other Chinese made brands primarily because they have a reputation for build quality, safety features, and reliability (confirmed by rigorous testing done by reputable reviewers). Amprobe is a division of Fluke (arguably the industry leader), providing a lower-priced product line. This Amprobe AM-510 is designed primarily for use by the DIY homeowner. This unit does not have True RMS or temperature readings, but the AM line provides more feature-rich units, for professional use, at higher price points. The AM-510 has all the basic features and functionality to tackle most home electrical projects which I expect to encounter. The auto-ranging, non-contact voltage sensing (which I found to work better than some other reviews indicated), basic battery test feature, and integrated flashlight are all pluses. The backlight feature is both a plus and the primary minus of this product. On the plus side, the backlight does not shut off after a few seconds like many other multimeters. It will actually stay lit until you turn it off. However, I found that, for some reason, when the backlight is on the screen can only be read in a very narrow range (just a few degrees) on the vertical plane. If you tilt the meter up or down beyond that narrow range, the numerals fade out completely and can't be read. When I discovered this on the first unit I received from Amazon, I returned it. When I found that the replacement unit did the same thing, I contacted Amprobe technical support. One very nice thing is that the 800 number on the Amprobe packaging actually connects you to the Fluke U.S. offices and you actually reach a U.S. technician. The tech I spoke with pulled an AM-510 off the shelf to see if he could replicate the issue and was surprised to discover that screen/backlight behaved exactly the same as mine. He said he had not been aware of the issue previously. He then went on to pick up and test other meters in the AM line (the 520, 530, 560, and 570) and found they all had the same issue. It's strange to me that an issue like that hasn't been mentioned before but, it is what it is. I've worked with many kinds of electronic equipment with backlit screens and have never seen this problem on any of them. As I said at the beginning, this is a good unit for the price and, for me, this quirk was not a big enough problem to send it back and start shopping all over again. But, if you're interested in buying one of these Amprobes, be aware that you might (and probably will) run into the same issue.First, let it be said if you are a professional electrician who needs a meter for everyday use, and needs the utmost in durability, quality and accuracy - why are you looking at this multimeter? I read a couple of reviews picking apart this low priced, $40 meter and was left scratching my head a bit. If you want a $250 meter, then go buy a Fluke or equivalent. Don't buy this, then measure it up to professional meters and write scathing reviews because it does not hold up to the scrutiny and measurement of much more expensive meters.I previously had only an Innova multimeter that I got here on Amazon for around $20 - and it has been a great meter for the price. (This one: https://www.amazon.com/INNOVA-3320-Auto-Ranging-Digital-Multimeter/dp/B000EVYGZA/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1524085919&sr=8-3&keywords=innova+voltmeter). For most infrequent homowner users who only want to measure voltage and occasional resistance - this $20 Innova would be all the meter you ever need.Recently I had the need to upgrade my multimeter as I also needed to measure capacitance. After briefly shopping around for a good ""bang for the buck"" meter, I settled on this Amprobe AM-510 Multimeter. In the end, I am glad I did - this is an outstanding meter for the price, and just as good or better than meters that are twice the price. Read the reviews - there are so many positive ones for good reason, this is a very good, durable multimeter for an outstanding price. This meter bridges the gap between the infrequent user who just needs a voltmeter, and the professional who needs everything. Look at this meter as something a more discerning hobbyist or homeowner would buy if they want a ""do it all"" multimeter, and plans on using it frequently.I could go on about what this meter does, but for that just read the description, or better yet the product's webpage or manual. Or you could read the length reviews here on Amazon that describe every feature and pick apart the meter as if it were a much more expensive, professional model.For the price and the value you get with this Amprobe AN-510, this is highly recommended.Thanks for reading.Pics attached: First pic shows the $20 Innova meter I mention above, alongside the Amprobe AM-510 in this ad. Notice the size difference - the AM-510 is not compact or small, it is quite heft. The second pic shows a close up of the Innova, and the third pic a closeup of the AM-510. If you are on a budget, and don't need a myriad of features - the Innova is a great meter for $20.Supongo que es debido a la competencia de multímetros chinos y por esa razón están bajando la calidad en los materiales de fabricación. Con opciones variadas de medición pero no totalmente preciso, una mucho mejor opción en cuanto a precisión y calidad de construcción es su hermano mayor (incluso se podría tratar de su padre) el modelo AM-270. No diría que es barato, diría que sencillamente obtienes lo que estás dispuesto a invertir.Me gustó:Sus variadas opciones de medición.Medición especial para prueba de pilas 1.5v y 9vLinterna incorporada.Detección de voltaje sin contacto ""NCV""BaratoMedición de frecuencia y ciclo de trabajo.No me gustó:Su calidad de construcciónImpreciso en la medición de voltajes (por lo menos en DC)Lento en la medición de resistencias.Prueba de continuidad (parece que el buzzer tuviera catarro)NO lo recomiendo, mejor invertir más y adquirir un modelo mucho mejor, más robusto y preciso, como su padre el Amprobe AM-270.I bought the Amprobe 510 to check voltage around a charging 12v lead acid battery and it works as intended. It is easy to use. It is more than adequate for household and general purpose use. I would highly recommend for beginners and new hobbyists.Arrived right on time. This unit was a replacement for another manufacturer's meter that failed and was turfed. Solid unit with a case that is non slip on a slanted surface. Leads seat positively. Rotary selection is solid and engaging. No variance in readings when compared to a more expensive meter. Good choice on my part, thanks to other positive reviews. Thanks Amprobe for a quality product.Good quality, I find that it is a bit slow to settle down at a reading (1-2 sec). But I'm used to mechanical probes which had instantaneous readings as long as you know how to read the scale. As previously noted the Non-contact voltage tester is fairly slow, and will not reliably penetrate walls so is fairly useless.The burden voltage is unacceptably high in the mA range. This makes it useless for the majority of my current measurements.","[""Measures voltage up to 600V AC/DC, AC/DC current and resistance, frequency, capacitance, duty cycle, battery test"",""Full-featured with non-contact voltage detection, audible continuity and diode test"",""Large backlit LCD display with data hold and relative zero mode"",""Durable, rubber overmolded enclosure"",""Safety Rated: CAT III 600V""]"

There is no 'thump' on the bass despite the wide frequency range that it supports.  The OEM wires on my factory standard speakers were 14 gauge. The wires on these speakers are 16 gauge.  Maybe that's standard, but you would think newer, quality speakers would have a heavier gauge wire than the OEM ones.  I thought I might have ""fake"" or ""clone"" speakers that are not genuine Pioneer. I contacted the Amazon seller, their non-Amazon store, and PioneerElectronics do determine if there is a visual way to check. I can't get a straight answer. There's no hologram on the box anymore apparently.  The Amazon seller claims they are an authorized Pioneer seller, and their non-Amazon store in Colorado Springs, Colorado and PioneerElectronics both confirm this. Because I'm so disappointed in the sound quality, I'm going to pull my door apart again, pull one 6.5"" door speaker, and take a picture of the back and see if PioneerElectronics can then verify they are original. Even if they are I may still send them back and get some JBLs instead. I'm running a new Kenwood DPX594BT stereo that I have to crank all of the Bass settings most of the way up to get solid bass including, equalizer settings, bass control, and loudness control. I wouldn't think I should have to do that. My wife's OEM standard factory speakers in her 2009 Rav4 sound better. I'd expect better out of something much newer.

The do include a supplemental sheet for installation on a Tacoma. However, the instructions must be outdated, as they were different from what I actually had to do.

That was small problem, but the larger problem was the screw in clamps for the front piece would not fit into the preexisting Tacoma bed track. I would like someone from the company to contact me to resolve.A small amount of water does get in if driving in a heavy rain storm. It appears to be coming in thru the front corners. I purchased a small length of gasket material (same as on the cover) and fixed the problem. I suggest the manufacturer furnish this same length of gasket to the customer so that they can also make this little addition to the installation if necessary.Had some shipping damage and missing pieces but contacted undercover and they got everything straighten out quickly.

Good purchaseNice rugged, secure case will protect my investment.Got same day delivery.Item is everything I expected.Exactly what I needed. Why I didn't find these sooner I don't know.This is a great set of broaches for putting key ways in pulleys and like shaft driven components. All the standard size are in this kit and it comes in a much nicer box than the one shown in the picture.The broach set works exactly as I expected even in mildly hard steel. Good keyway finish with minimal burrs.The wooden box was badly damaged because it was shipped in an oversized cardboard box without filler/padding. Unacceptable for a $200 purchase!Arrived very quickly, the box is inexpensive but does the job. All the machining seems to be very good.Haven’t used it yet but it looks like it will do the jobs (brass) that I need.came with a puncture right thru the tool case lidI bought this to teach my future maritime engineer students how to broach key ways. We love using it!I am quite happy with the quality of this set. It arrived a day early. The quality of the box could be better. The finger joints on one end of the box came apart and I had to glue the end back in. No big deal. I only need to broach a key way a few times a year and couldn’t justify spending over $1000 for a top brand set. And it’s frustrating having to rely on another shop to broach one key way. So this set fills my needs perfectly.I’ve only used the 3/8’s cutter for some 1” bore dies I made for my tube roller they were 3” long and using my press they made flawless key ways. Have an air over hydraulic press was well worth it. Dies were 1018 steelThey like to bite metals quite a bitThe broaches have an excellent finish. The set was missing one piece but the company was very prompt at shipping me the missing part. It's nice to see some quality workmanship again.

The wide design and small footprint of this receptacle hugs the wall to provide maximum volume while using space efficiently. These garbage cans feature convenient foot pedals with increased pedal clearance for easy foot access and hands-free waste disposal.

Providing safe, sanitary waste management, these plastic trash cans are perfect for use in health care environments.

Should outlast your run of the mill trash can by 10x.I tried to find a good alternative to Simply Human, but the Simply Human is still the better product for stability, holding open the lid, and getting the bag in and out.Good product, well madePleased with my purchase so far. Love the size and that it’s slim. Fits perfect where I needed it to.Omg I love this can, my son also ordered one the best ever Thanks Amazon.This can is much taller than expected. If you're hoping this will fit your 18 gallon trash bags, it will not. The rim of the bags will be so taught that the securing rods refuse to lay down flat. The rods do not ""click"" into place. There is about 9 inches of unused can below the bag once installed. You should probably use 20 or 22 gallon bags for this can, but those are just too large for my kitchen. I wish someone had warned me before purchasing.The mechanism works fine and seems sturdy. There is a rod piece sticking out from the bottom so it can't be flat against a wall. This is for stability and allows the lid to open fully without hitting the wall.I purchased this in the 13 gallon red. It looks nice, although it would've been nicer had Rubbermaid put their logo on the back instead of the top front. It also doesn't sit flush against the wall, due to the metal bar in back. The only question I have is how long the hinge on the cover will last. It is just molded plastic, not reinforced in any way. I notice in some of the other reviews that the hinge didn't last past a few months due to the flimsy hinge. It doesn't take much pressure to open the lid enough to throw something away, my suggestion is to try not to stomp too hard when discarding anything. Pressing lightly is enough to open it. Other than that, it is a really nice looking trash can.I'd been looking at trash cans trying to make sure I got a good one. I finally decided on this one. Even though it was a little pricey for a trash can. I decided to take a chance on an open box, because after all it is just a trash can. It said it had some minor cosmetic issues. Well! When it arrived, it was perfect! No cosmetic issues at all! I love it! It works great. I actually get a little excited everytime I open it! When I change the bag it is so easy and the bag stays secure! The step to raise the lid and the gentle, self closing it do convenient! As you can tell, I don't have a lot to be excited about in my life. Lol This trash can has brought me some joy!❤️It really is quite big in the clinic but when you are paying for waste disposal by the bag you really want a bin that allows you to fill the bag right up and this does. Worth noting that the lid can't be opened by hand which is good for infection control. Mark removed because the slow close is a bit unreliable and the first part of the lid falling is at full speed meaning a blast of air still comes from the bin it just doesn't slam down at the last part.bin is very well made, holds a lot of waste and the step on function very handy and hygienic. Step on function has stopped working after 18 months in a small cafe so now pretty useless. Tried contacting Rubbermaid UK through amazon, website and social media and got nothing from any channel. Have given up so this is destined for landfill. Wouldn't buy again.Fab bin, well made, sturdy, does the job perfectly.Purchased to use in a support service to help with covid infection control.Good looking bin. Slim design, but holds lots. Useful foot pedal, and quite when closing. Good for price. Well made.It's very good size bin.","[""Wide design with a small footprint hugs the wall to provide maximum volume while using space efficiently"",""Quiet and controlled lid closure reduces noise"",""Convenient foot pedal allows hands-free waste disposal while the tall pedal clearance allows easy foot access"",""Internal hinge design prevents wall damage"",""Liner retainer band securely holds garbage bags""]"

This then can be spent on a large assortment of ""sticker packs"" which give you anything from summonable zombies, plantable plants, cosmetic adjustments, modified abilities, new character variants (which all play a bit differently from the base class with a different primary weapon) and more.The game also rewards individual classes for doing their job. Engineers can make bank by establishing forward teleporter positions, making it easier for you team to raid (and getting coins everytime someone then uses it). Cactus get extra coins if OTHER classes are able to take advantage of well placed cover. Chompers get a hefty amount of coins for ""shield breaking"" the outer shell of tougher zombies with a burrow emerge (no idea why this got omitted from the second game). Pretty much every class has special coin boosts and it promotes newer and inexperienced players to AT LEAST do their job if nothing else.As for basic random progression, this should be considered a good thing. Some folks will get frustrated that they don't get exactly the variants the want and have no where specific to go to find them, but the upside is it makes it a VERY unique experience for every player. I still remember my first Zombie unlock on my XBOX One account, The Goalie Star. To me, he looked great, did a little less damage then normal but slowed and froze enemies, and gave me my love for the All-star Class. A friend of mine unlocked the Toxic Pea first, arguably the best ""trooper"" type on the plant side, played that guy once and never looked back. This makes for a fun experience where you never know what you are going to get. These classes all have downsides to their standard variant, and don't break the game that some players get some before others.One could argue that there are 3 upgrade stickers that get thrown into the sticker pool once a particular zombie or plant has been unlocked and they are too weak to play until you get those. One, the upgrades are marginal. Two, you gain a crap ton of coins from the co-operative mode, Garden Ops, which you can play until you unlock those. Three, there is always the welcome matt you can play until you get enough coins to buy more packs to unlock their extras.Finally, the achievement vs experience system is great. To level up your characters, you need accomplish achievements such us a particular move so many times, take out so many enemies, or even take out so many players. Some of these can be rather circumstantial, tricky, or just plain really difficult. Not to worry. The packs have you covered on that as well. As you are opening packs you get ""Star Challenge Skip"" stickers which always you to automatically unlock that achievement. So basically, however you want to play the game, you will eventually, through attrition, get everyone to max level anyway (which is more a bragging thing then anything. The later levels just give you additional coins, not more hit points or new stickers or anything). It allows the game to be goal oriented, encourages players to try new things, but at the end of the day, if you are struggling or the other players are making it impossible to accomplish some (take out Bonk Choy plants for example.....if the players aren't planting them, you can't exactly get this done) you can skip it. And you earned it by some other means, since that was you sticker in your pack!!So all and all, it would be nice for more games to use this overall method of progression if they are going the ""pack/loot box"" route with microtrans as a side income. At no point did I feel I needed to buy additional coins, and there was an obvious ""pros vs cons"" for any character that I saw people using once I really got a decent amount of exposure to them before I got them.(As a side, the one exception was the Tank Commander Zombie. I was always floor how fast they could kill me all of a sudden and thought they must be broken and was confused I didn't see them more......until I unlocked him. Guy is literally running around with a tank cannon that is hard to hit with, doesn't do the greatest damage, until you CRIT on someone. Explains the sudden drops, and always explains the seldom use)muy buenoKeeps grandson happy and was the perfect birthday giftMany of the 1-star and 2-star reviews seem to be motivated by the fact that the game must be played online with only a multiplayer mode and no single player campaign. I think people can figure out for themselves whether this is a problem, and whether the price point is acceptable given the lack of single player campaign. The rating should be based on the content that exists.The game is addictive, with classes leveling up for completing tasks (usually 15 for each level), such as ""vanquish 25 zombies with your primary weapon"" or ""vanquish 5 peashooters with imp punts."" Some tasks are more onerous than others, but you can collect ""skip stars"" from card packs that you purchase with points that allow you to skip those tasks that you don't want to bother with.The number of points you earn is based on your performance in game. Typically 2 rounds of Gardens & Graveyards (G&G, a mode where zombies must occupy 7-9 gardens in sequence, each for a certain amount of time and within a certain amount of time before advancing to the next garden) will get you at least 20K points, with sticker packs costing anywhere from 1K (for consumables) to 40K (for weapon upgrades, new characters, and consumables), with prices being based on the items they potentially contain. It's an addictive system that encourages you to play ""just one more game"".As for the price point vs. lack of single player campaign... let's just say a game with only a single player campaign will typically take 10-15 hours to complete. The multiplayer for this game will keep you occupied for dozens upon dozens of hours, if not more. To unlock every level for every character class could take you upwards of 100+ hours, so I don't personally see being cheated by no campaign.As for my review of 4 vs. 5 stars given my glowing remarks....there are a lot of hiccups with the servers. Usually 1 out of every 3 G&G matches will have hang ups where characters start glitching and the game comes to a virtual halt. About 1 out of every 10 or so G&G matches will results in getting kicked to the starting menu, losing the opportunity to collect the points you've been earning in the match.This is an absolutely adorable game! The graphics aren't too bad for a game meant to be silly. The characters and class variations are very fun. The game does not require you to buy coins to unlock characters, weapons or customizations...the amount you can earn in game are quite generous, and I have never even considered paying for extra coins. The publishers have continued to provide seasonal stickers and in-game variations, so that is a big plus.There are only two things I could gripe about is that the number of maps feels quite limited at times. Also, while they have ""classic vanquish"" or ""classic gardens and graveyards"" modes, not many people play those, and I usually end up solo. That isn't against the game, it is just people queuing up in the other variations.The second is the party system. In garden open, you go to a screen where you can select the map, difficulty, invite friends, and all that, and it works well. However, in standard multiplayer, it only has the option to ""join as party,"" meaning who you have in your PS party chat. I'd be fine with this, however, the person who queues up finds a match, joins, and then it sends an invite to the other player(s) via PSN. The person/people then have to accept it, and hope that they can get into the match...and that they are on the same side. My friend just got the game, we tried to play together, and it pitted me against him...in my highest vanquish match ever.This game is a rip off. Bought it for my grandson not having seen the one line that states you need ps plus or knowing what that is. Once you have paid for the game it won't let you play it until you pay£50 a year extra to play online, which we don't want to do. So you are buying a game you can't use, it is a ripoffPaid for this, then needed PS4 account at 50£ to be able to play the game. Combined price....70£. Definitely not worth anywhere near this. Daylight robbery!Good game, but I've only given 3 stars as you have to pay for playstation plus in order to use this, which is £20 for 3 months. Bought as a gift so i had no choice but to pay it or have a disappointed child.The game was for my grandson and he loves itUseless","[""24-player multiplayer action - Choose your side, plants or zombies, in 24-player online battles"",""Customization - Personalize your favorite plants and zombies with hundreds of unique items and customizations"",""4-player online co-op - Join forces with friends in online 4-player cooperative mode"",""New plants and zombies - Powerful new plants and zombies with a huge variety of abilities""]"

I have purchased 6 pairs. I got my first one 7 months ago. The first pair was for me so I could use them when paddleboarding because they are waterproof. Since then, I bought a pair for my mom, dad, and uncle each. They all loved them and use them all the time. None of them are tech savvy, but I was able to help all 3 of them separately figure out how to use blue tooth to connect them for the first time over the phone without much trouble. My family is very outspoken, so they would definitely tell me the truth if they didn't like them.I lost my right one from my first pair, so I bought another pair. Within a few weeks, I accidentally lost the left side of my second pair somehow, so I tried putting the two sides from the different pairs together in one case, and they worked together after that! All of my other purchased pairs were black, so I decided to purchase the rose gold ones as a back up. They are so much more beautiful than I thought they would be, and I LOVE them.What I like about them: I am a delivery driver that works 10 hour shifts. These bx29's are the only headphones I've tried out of 3 brands that actually last through my whole shift. This one lasts about 10 hrs. The other 2 brands I tried were the Orancu A12 which lasted 7-8 hrs and was poorly made and broke within a few months from normal use, and a different one from Rizzizi (same people as Orancu) that was nice but with a horrific battery that lasted less than 2 hours. These BX29's  feel well made. The button layout is good and easy to use. They stay on my ear well. They came with 3 sizes of the thing that goes in your ear for comfort. I have used them in the shower to test and they really are waterproof. The charging indicator is on the outside and easy to read. They pair automatically when you take them out of the case or otherwise turn them on. They block out quite a bit of noise from outside when they are in your ear (moreso than the other brands I tried.) Call quality is fine (better than my $300 Samsung phone on its own.)What I don't like: The one thing I would change is adding some kind of wind blocker or something if possible because when it gets slightly windy, the person I am talking to can hear the wind a lot. (This will be the same for any headphones that don't have some kind of wind breaker I think.)Overall, I am very happy with these and hope they never get discontinued.","[""Designed for Sport and IP7 Waterproof 2023 BX29 White wireless bluetooth earbud with soft, flexible, and secure-fit earhooks gently to the contours of your ears without falling out even for workout, and the ergonomic design ensure your headphones stay comfortably firm in place when running, hiking, jogging, and other activity.

The price seemed a little expensive (about the cost of 15 books) but it was priced competitively against all the other readers of it's class.I like that it is exactly as advertised:The lighting is consistent on my device and the color grade from blue-white to white to yellowish is smooth and customizable. Even at very low settings on the brightness it stays consistent, so keeping the light very low while reading at night in bed next to your partner is very possible with this reader.Overdrive integration just works.I use a free software to transfer over a collection of epub books I've previously gotten. Worked like a charm; no headaches.Page turning is fast when using the buttons, I would say about a quarter of a second or faster. There is a slight delay using the touchscreen to turn the page, about half a second. It's not bad but a little noticeable. Black screen with white text works well though sometimes when you page turn it flashes the inverse before applying the white text on black theme. Not a big deal, its not like the brightness changes.The device is pretty light and the side bezel is perfect to fit under the base of the thumb. The buttons are ergonomic easy to press with the tip of your thumb for page turning. I have a bit of a gut so if you are like me you can sit in a recliner and rest it on your gut and page turn with the buttons easily.The size of the device is about perfect. Big enough that I can expand the text on the screen a little and the screen still shows lots of text so you are page-turning constantly. It's about the size of two Galaxy S10+ put side-to-side. Except it weighs maybe slightly less that just one of the phones. The weight is balanced nicely on the device, slightly heavier on the bezel side where you grip it but not too much so.Battery life seems solid. I know their metric is 30 minutes of reading per day and I have my device on the white-text-on-black and about 15% brightness but I can see by that amount of reading it will probably last as long as advertised. If you are a heavy reader you will get about a week of reading before you need to plug it in. From 1% charge it took about 2 hours to get it to full, though I'm guessing as I didn't really time it. Considering how much reading you get from just a few percentages of battery life that's perfectly fine.It's water-resistant! I live in a rainy climate. I could go outdoors with it and not have to worry about it dying. I wouldn't submerge the thing in the ocean but this could be read in the bathtub without worry or be taken on a camping trip or hike. Some other similarly priced readers don't have this feature.Overall, this was exactly what I was hoping for when I purchased it.Oh, but there is a downside.

I asked my 14-yr-old son to help me move it upstairs to my bedroom; he misunderstood me and moved it there on his own while I was at work!My wife wanted a Medium Firm mattress, so we chose this one. To be honest, my concern was that being people on the heavier side, Medium firmness wouldn't be our best choice, but I tire of decisions like these, so I went with her thinking. I can sleep on most any surface, and this was our first new mattress in 22 years.As advertised, when the vacuum seal had been broken, the son-of-a-gun rolled itself out and began expanding. I'd chosen to do this on a Saturday because that's one day I'm home when my wife gets up early. That gave the new mattress all day to fill out. (This is the worst-written review I've ever done, but I have Covid and my thinking's screwy.) The point is, the mattress had plenty of time to fill out before we slept on it. She went and bought new bedding for it, and we went to sleep on a cloud that night.1. It's very bouncy.2. The sides are firmer than the middle, so there's a tendency to roll in from the edges. It's not severe, but I do notice it.3. We should have gotten the Firm mattress, not the Medium (according to her). I've just kept my mouth shut other than to say it's still 100x better than our old mattress.4. No idea if it's too bouncy for marital fun (haven't had it much longer than I've had Covid), but not sure I'll tell you when I know, either. That may be TMI.5. The fifth star isn't on the review because of numbers 1 and 2 above, but6. We like it and we'll keep it. Given the price, we'll pony up and get another one in a few years if we see the need to change the settings. By then we'll have to have the younger son visiting to move it, or we'll just move our bedroom downstairs to accommodate the situation.Bought this queen size mattress for my son to take to college because I was concerned a standard spring mattress might not easily fit in the elevator and I didn’t want to fight with a mattress during move-in day chaos. Right out of the box, as soon as we cut away the plastic, it inflated. It was fully inflated within hours not days, and son reports it is more comfy than his expensive spring mattress at home. Hopefully, it’s bendable enough to cram into an elevator at the end of the year and that it lasts long enough for him to graduate. For now, he’s happy, so I’m happy.Never used this brand before. It expands really fast after opening the package. Suggestion: two man carry if you move it up or down stairs. It’s pretty heavy. Feels super comfy too. Great product for its price.I was hesitant about a mattress in a box but this is an amazing mattress. It is great quality for a great price! I bought for my daughter and she says it’s very comfortable. As an added bonus, Opening the mattress was fun !!For the price of this mattress it is well worth its purchase. I literally went to a mattress firm store and they were selling mattresses for $3000+. Not worth the money in my opinion. On the other hand, when the mattress self - inflates there’s no smell and it takes about an hour to fully inflate. It’s definitely 10in and depending on your bed height you may not necessarily need a box spring.soft true to size and lite weight made very wellIt's a medium firmness mattress so if that's what you like (like I do) this is a really good mattress. Especially considering the price. In person it doesn't look quite as thick or premium as the picture suggests but the quality seems fine and it's comfortable all the same. If you're on a budget and don't have time to deal with returns I'd say this is a safe bet.I love a firm bed so this is exactly what I was looking for. The moment I let it air up from the box it was everything I wanted I can tell this is a great mattress from my first nights rest. The quality is great and the price is great.","[""Cool Gel Memory Foam Hybrid Mattress Twin Size: Waking up hot at the midnight disrupts your good night’s sleep.

Nordic Pure 16x25x2 MERV 8 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filters 3 Pack,Nordic Pure,"Product Description Nordic Pure MERV 8 Pleated AC Furnace Air Filters provide exceptional filtration for both home and commercial environments. MERV 8 furnace filters are comparable to HVAC filters with the rating of MPR 800. Nordic Pure furnace air filters are manufactured using a heavy duty, moisture resistant beverage board frame. As with all Nordic Pure furnace air filters, the material is electrostatically charged to attract unwanted particles. The media used will not promote the growth of bacteria or mold on the air filter. For fresh, clean air in your home and office, it is important to regularly change your AC filter, especially during home improvements. We recommend changing your HVAC furnace filter every 1-3 months, depending on your unique home or office environment. People with pets or those who suffer from allergies should change their A/C air filters more often. Replacing your air filter regularly not only improves indoor air quality, it helps your HVAC unit perform more efficiently. Important Note: Almost all air condition filters have a different Actual Size than Nominal Size printed on the air conditioning filter. It is best to measure the exact size of your A/C filter and compare it to our Actual Size to be sure your HVAC replacement filter fits! From the Manufacturer The Nordic Pure MERV 8 anti-allergen pleated air filters are made out of an electrostatically charged synthetic material that draws airborne particulates to it like a magnet. Electrostatic filters help trap airborne particles to protect your family from pollen, household dust, mold spores, and dust mites. With each pass through the pleated filtered, the air in your living environment improves. Nordic Pure's synthetic filter media will not permit the growth of bacteria or mold, therefore, making your environment healthier. This air filter will capture other large particle contaminants to keep surfaces free of dust longer in your home. MERV 8 air filters are comparable to air filters with the MPR rating of 500-600 or FPR rating of Green. Particles in indoor air are measured in microns, which are 1/1000 of a millimeter. A human hair is about 70 microns wide. A MERV 8 Nordic Pure air filter captures airborne particles as small as 3.0 to 10.0 microns. This high performance air filter will outperform non-electrostatic fiber-glass filters, washable filters, and poly disposable filters. The MERV 8 electrostatic pleated air filter will help keep your air conditioning and heating systems running efficiently, saving on utilities and maintenance costs. The effectiveness of your air filter will depend on your environment. We recommend that you change the air filter every 30-90 days depending on the conditions in your home.","[""Tools & Home Improvement"",""Building Supplies"",""HVAC"",""Furnace Parts & Accessories"",""Furnace Filters""]",‎Nordic Pure,,Quality filters without the overpriced cost of so called name brands.,"[""Nominal Size: 16 x 25 x 2, Actual Size: 15 1/2 x 24 1/2 x 1 3/4 (15.5 x 24.5 x 1.75)"",""Measure your air filter for the exact size and compare it to our actual size to ensure proper fit."",""This dust reduction air filter is ideal in keeping your AC and furnace equipment working efficiently and helps reduce odors"",""Nordic Pure MERV 8 is equivalent to MPR 800"",""Made in the USA""]"

While shopping for blackout curtains, I found that light colored curtains sometimes don't block out the sun as effectively as darker ones, but these block 100% of the light, except whatever light comes in through the gap between the curtain and the wall. I love the light taupe color which is neutral enough for any decor. The fabric is thick with elegant woven pattern. The dark photo was taken during the daytime like the rest of the photos, just with the curtains drawn and light turned off. I didn't iron the curtains before hanging them up and I tie them back during the day, which is why they look wrinkled in the last photo, which was taken with the room's light turned on. Although the fabric is a bit stiff and not very soft, I think it should be easy enough to iron out the wrinkles.",null

They worked quite well. They were easy to carry. And when empty, they did not take up much space or add much weight to my load which is limited.The spigot works well, though I did use a knife and carefully increased the opening on the spigot for greater water flow. I am not quite sure why they have the regular caps attached at back of the storage container. I don't have a college degree, so I will have to find someone with a degree to help me figure that one out. I guess that I did not pass Logic 101. Relocating the regular caps was a challenge.A note of caution. It is wise to put the red cap on when transporting water in these containers. The blue spigots are handy when dispensing the water. Otherwise, keep the red caps on. Your spigot will not be accidentally opened and water spilled in areas where it is not desired. I add that as ""Lessons Learned"".These water containers are very sturdy and I think they will take a lot of abuse. They definitely serve my purpose and I would recommend them for anyone needing to store or carry an additional water supply.","[""Made with food grade LDPE4 plastic, BPA free, odorless, and compliant with latest USA standards"",""Patented leak-proof spigot with separate outer lid prevents any leakage while carrying or transporting"",""Collapsible, lightweight, and portable design; folds down for compact storage and transport"",""Perfect for outdoor activities like camping, hiking, fishing, and hunting as well as emergency water storage"",""Includes free 36-page eBook on camping and emergency preparedness""]"

Extend the life and enhance the durability of painting jobs by providing a quality base coat proven to give top-of-the-line adhesion to a wide range of coatings, even on difficult surfaces and substrates. Many of these best-selling primers come in both traditional quarts/gallons for roll and brush on applications as well as quick-apply aerosol sprays. Difficult or problem surfaces? Not an issue. Check Zinsser's full line of specialized primers. Prime a wide range of interior and exterior surfaces, including: Wood Metal Plaster Concrete Tile Glass Gloss Enamels ...and more! Do It Right the First Time Why it's important to prime Priming isn't just an extra step in the painting process - it ensures that the work and money spent painting surfaces isn't wasted. Use primer as a buffer between what you need to paint and the top coat you want to use to make sure that nothing interferes with the final appearance of your work. Reasons to prime: Prevents top coat paints from flaking, scraping or scratching away easily by providing better adhesion to surfaces Seals or bonds to difficult-to-paint surfaces, allowing regular paint to be used on otherwise impossible surfaces Can cover and eliminate surface problems (like water damage, odors and more) so that they can be painted directly over without repairs Creates a smooth, uniform coating that ensure top coat paint goes on easily and evenly Covers up bright or dark colors to help paint require less coats to achieve ""true"" color Protects items from wear and weathering when used better than paint can alone Before Cover up outdated, dark colors... After ...with a bright new look! Before Seal away problem areas, stains and odors... After ...for a like-new, paintable surface!

"iGrow Laser Hair Growth Helmet: Restoration & Regrowth Treatment System for Hair Loss - Natural Thinning, Balding, and Alopecia Solution for Men and Women - FDA Cleared Low Level Laser Device",iGrow,"Do you look in the mirror each morning and notice that you’re seeing less and less hair? If so, you’re not alone-nearly everyone over 30 will experience some kind of hair loss-a receding hairline, a growing “bald spot” or just general thinning.However it starts, one thing’s for certain: fast or slow, genetic hair loss is progressive and doesn’t get better on its own. If you’re one of the millions of men and women who don’t want to just accept your thinning hair and have been looking for an effective, non-surgical, drug-free solution, now there’s hope with the iGrow Hair Growth System. The iGrow uses a technology called Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT) to stimulate those under-performing follicles to work harder at what they’re meant to do- GROW HAIR. LLLT has been available in doctors’ offices, clinics and high-end salons for many years, but was inconvenient and costly until Apira Science, a pioneer and world leader in light-based treatments for hair &amp; skin, created the iGrow to make makes this safe and effective treatment easy, convenient and affordable to do in the comfort and privacy of your home. Unlike cumbersome, under-powered handhelds or devices that just treat one area at a time, the iGrow is designed to bathe the entire scalp at once, hands-free, in gentle therapeutic red light at the wavelength and power shown most effective in stimulating hair growth. Dual-voltage for use worldwide, iGrow plugs right into a standard outlet for consistent power and no batteries to recharge or replace, and is easy to use while you read, watch TV, browse the web or just sit back and listen to music on the high-quality headphones. For Thicker and Stronger Hair The iGrow was created to give hands-free, full scalp coverage comfortably. Combining laser and LED light diodes, iGrow stimulates, energizes and revives follicles at the cellular level so they can grow thicker, stronger hair again. Just 25 Minutes Every Other Day All it takes is 25 minutes a few times per week. Think you can’t find the time? The iGrow’s convenient, hands-free design makes it easy to regrow your hair while you’re watching TV, checking email, browsing the web, reading or just listening to music. Fits All Head Sizes If you feel like sharing, don’t worry! The iGrow Laser Hair Growth Helmet has adjustable headphones, moveable spacing columns and rotating weight distribution. One size fits nearly everyone! Read more Hands-Free, Hassle-Free The iGrow is clinically proven and FDA-cleared for safe, effective treatment of genetic hair loss.

Convenient, lightweight and comfortable, iGrow makes is easy to treat your whole scalp at the same time at home, on your schedule, for maximum results with minimal effort. Read more Low Level Light Therapy (LLLT) iGrow was one of the first to take highly-effective, hands-free LLLT for thinning hair out of the clinic and into the privacy of home. Red light energy at the optimal wavelength and power is delivered to the scalp, where it’s absorbed into the cells and surrounding tissues. The energized cells’ function and efficiency increase, leading to improved productivity. With continued treatment this process, called photobiomodulation , helps damaged or minimized follicles do what they’re meant to do- GROW STRONGER, THICKER HAIR.

Read more","[""Beauty & Personal Care"",""Hair Care"",""Hair Loss Products"",""Hair Regrowth Devices""]","‏  ‎ DSI Systems, Inc.",‏  ‎ Skin Care,"I've been looking for a long time for a product like this. I am interested in not only some improvement in the hair, but also increase blood flow to your skull. Which I know red laser products do. Now when I sit and listen to my podcast every other day I can work on my head. I like it too because I can pipe in the podcast to the earpieces. I couldn't have had more simple instructions than these expected for sure. Very simple it's very clearI'm happy with it. You MUST use it every other day and you won't see results until after 1 year if you have hair. I think if you have very little hair you will see results sooner since it is easier to see the fine hairs growing. With newly thinning hair it is hard to see the little hairs through the hair you have. At first you may lose some hair - this is a natural process.My dermatologist recommended this. She also said that new hair growth was like baby fine hair. Then later it will thicken up.One note of importance, if your hair had stopped growing 3 years ago, it will not grow back. You cannot be bald for a number of years and expect your hair to grow back. A hair follicle gone for 3 years or more will not come back. But a hair follicle gone under 3 years seems to be fine. If you start when you see you are loosing hair, your chances of getting it back are good. If you start when your hair is getting finer, this should work to thicken it up. Also, if you don't keep it up, you will go back to losing the hair. This is a life commitment. If you miss a few weeks because of vacation or traveling, it is okay, if your hair is coming back. The bottom line is: if you are home, do it every other day forever.The helmet has a nice timer, has several differ patterns of lights for various hair-loss types, is easy to use.Do not be fooled that this looks like a gimicky, overly expensive product for gullible people. I've been using this product consistently for 4 months 20 minutes every other day. After the first two weeks, I noticed that my hair felt slightly different. A little bit fuller, a little bit stronger. For the first month, I still lost a decent amount of hair. On the second, I lost very little hair. Then on the third month, I lost almost no hair at all. There is almost no hair I see in the shower drain! This product by itself has saved my hair. Even before buying this product, I did some of my own research. Even though their own research might be backed by them, I looked at others and they seem to come with a similar conclusion. I have tried Rogaine and Rogaine has done nothing for me. It is both messy and makes my scalp itch. This product on the other was very simple to use. It takes only 2 button presses to start a 20 minute session. On the downside, I haven't been able to grow the hair back at the front of my forehead, but I haven't lost any hair either and my hairline is no longer receding. This has given me hope that there will be better solutions down the line but at least I'm no longer losing hair.Well, I have to say, its been four days now and I know I'm not imagining it; the fistful clumps of hair falling out have stopped. I had some emotional changes a month and a half ago, and my hair began falling out in clumps. It began thinning all over; no exposed scalp but just a lot less hair in general. I know these cycles eventually stop, but this was getting stressful; I had nice long hair and now just strands of hair hanging. I wanted something that would stop more hair from falling out. I used this more than recommended. 25 min the first day, and 20 minutes the second and third days. Today I just used it for 13 minutes until my scalp got all tingly from the device. I can feel it working stimulating the follicles. I think this might be the miracle I was looking for just to save the rest of my hair from falling out so fast. It doesn't grow hair crazy fast like the biotin in Rainbow Light Prenatal 1, but that is okay with me because I have processed hair and don't want fast grow out because I want to wait in between salon visits. I just wanted the hair that I had to stay in. Excited!!!I have only had the product about 5 days and have used it only twice (recommends only twice a week or every other day at the most), so my review is only based on comfort and design. Cannot comment on the product's ability to live up to its claims to regrow hair yet.As for comfort and design, it is constructed well and is much easier to use than I thought it would be. The controls are fool proof, where you simply choose a picture for what your baldness pattern looks like, then start. it automatically stops after that particular program's time limit is reached. no chance of overexposure or anything. It is comfortable to wear and the built-in headphones are of decent quality too. Only issue is that when I want to watch TV instead of listening to a connected device through the headphone jack, I wish the headphones could be moved out of the way or removed entirely. Harder to hear, but not impossible.Overall, for the money I am satisfied but am far from noticing any hair growth results as it is way too early!So, I reviewed this prior to finding out there is no return from the manufacturer if it doesn't work. One of the reviews I read prior to purchasing it was from a buyer who said that after 6 months he was able to return it to the manufacturer because he didn't get the results he wanted. That was the only reason I purchased the IGrow. Now I find out that the seller I purchased it from is not the manufacturer and that there is no return policy in place. The company won't stand behind it because I didn't pay $695, their cost. Amazon's return period expired so I'm stuck with the product. You really have to be careful purchasing anything from Amazon. BTW, the Amazon credit card with Chase is going to give you 3% on only a small number of products that are Amazon products. The rest of them get 1% just like you went to the store and used your card. My love affair with Amazon is over. I'm not going to do all my Christmas shopping with them like I've done in the last 2 years. It's a pretty one sided relationship.Scomodo da indossare perchè pesa, e nessun beneficio visibile, anche dopo mesi. Quando mi sono stancato di usarlo hanno ripreso a cadermi più capelli di prima. Di tutti i capelli in fase di miniaturizzazione, nessun segnale minimo di ricrescita! Sconsigliatissimo!!!Do 3 stelle perche Amazon Prime e unico.Per me questo casco non ha funzionato.

Also, das Gerät funktioniert. Es gibt nach 4 Monaten bereits verstärkt neuen Haarwuchs und die vorhandenen Haare werden kräftiger. Natürlich ist auch dieses Gerät kein Wundermittel und ich glaube nicht, dass die Haare wieder so dicht werden wie früher. Allerdings bin ich persönlich zufrieden und bin auf das Ergebnis nach 12 Monaten gespannt. So viel Zeit muss man übrigens auch nach einer Transplantation einplanen.l'ayant testé durant un mois (sachant que le premier résultats sont censé apparaître au bout de 3 semaine), je peux affirmer que cette appareil n'en vaut pas la chandelle. Les cheveux sont certes un peu plus denses, mais continuent de tomber. La luminothérapie est une réel solution à la chute de cheveux, mais les produits issues de cette solution ne sont pas assez avancés et encore qu'à l'état expérimental. Pour preuve, si cela marchait vraiment, personne ne pairait des greffes, minoxidil etc..). pour la luminothérapie, il est encore conseillé d'attente 4 ou 5 an le temps que les produits se développent réellement.Excellent","[""The iGrow patented, hands-free, convenienct and private in-home hair growth system provides full scalp coverage, is fully portable, easy to use and requires no manual movement."",""iGrow incorporates Apira Sciences proprietary dual light laser and LED design.

These medium thickness size 10 Wide SOLE inserts fit snugly with just a touch of trimming off the front using a sturdy pair of scissors. I have a normally arched foot so perhaps a highly arched / high volume wide foot would need the thin version of SOLE inserts. I also purchased (and subsequently returned) the thick version of the inserts but they were too thick for my shoes. Because of some negative reviews, I chose not to heat-mold the inserts. After a few days of wear they have custom-shaped to my feet and are quite comfortable.My normal Sole Medium insoles were not quite wide enough for my new Altra Olympus 4 trail running shoes. These wide version Sole insoles are perfectly sized and shaped for how wide the foot is on Altra shoes.The size 11 men's Sole medium wide insole fits perfectly into a size 10.5us Altra Olympus 4 shoe without any trimming. It's nearly the exact shape and size of the stock insole.I've been using them for years in all my shoes and they are not only very supportive, but also very durable and long lasting. My other pair has probably seen around 900 miles of hard use.I am really impressed with the quality of this orthodic. The whole unit looks like it would last forever.Stiff arch.I love the WIDE size ...which means the toe box area fits an ALTRA trail shoe almost perfectly.BUTTTTT ... it is advertised as a medium arch and it is not. I have been trying various other orthodics ...curex, super feet, etc ...all medium arch support and this SOLE is definitely on the high side.So much so that it was uncomfortable to walk in.So, it had to go back.Suggested by friend, thoroughly impressedI have flat feet(not just kinda flat, they squish out where the arch should be) I use to ware doc s insoles but they never were quite right, then I was talking to a customer at work and they said the sole brand is what I needed. He was right after the 2nd full day of working in them my back problems started to get better(it will always be there just the nature of the beast). I will buy again and recommend them to anyone with foot/back/knee problemsThese insoles are great. They work almost as well as the ones I got from the podiatrist. I have had plantar fasciitis for years I needed new Orthotics , I went to the podiatrist and was quoted $450, since I'm on disability that was out of the question and Medicare does not pay for Orthotics. It took a couple days for the pain to go away and my feet still get sore but they don't hurt.I have a torn ligament on the inside and bottom of my interior right foot. I tried re-hab the first year then scheduled surgery and was delayed due to the C-Virus and will go a second year now due to timing. The SOLE are the item recommended by my Dr. and that allows me to walk without significant pain. They cost about 1/10th what custom inserts cost and work better from my experience. I own about 10 pair of them in all my different shoes and boots. I'll decide in 2021 if surgery is in the cards. It does appear to be very slowly getting slightly better.My only complaint is they are very pricey.Would definitely buy again. Fits the shoes perfectly and provides much needed support and comfort.Expensive but who cares - they work extremely well.Feeling great!!","[""SOLE footbeds are recommended by podiatrists as an effective alternative to prescription orthotics"",""Featuring medium cushioning and a wider forefoot specifically designed to fit wide and natural splay footwear"",""Custom heat or wear moldable and clinically proven to reduce plantar fascia strain by 34 percent, aiding with plantar fasciitis pain relief"",""Zero drop, deep heel cup and dynamic arch support offer neutral alignment and pressure distribution"",""Insole features Polygiene coating for active odor-control using recycled silver salt, and packaged in SOLE's eco friendly plastic free packaging""]"

Comes out in a fine spray (so it lasts pretty long), and wonderful citrus scent. It detangles my waist length hair…(of an older gal), without causing brittleness or residue or a cloyingly sweet scent. You need look no further. In my opinion, this WORKS LIKE MAGIC to make those awful tangles just slip right out!!! Yes, I highly recommend!!Mamis totalmente recomendado,yo lo compré para mi bebe varón ya que tiene mucho cabello y se le enredaba mucho de atrás y hasta nuditos se le hacían y con este producto ya no se le hacen,le queda súper suave,hidratado sin ningún olor y les cuento que lo empece a usar para mis puntas abiertas y me lo deja muy suave y hidratadoSo originally I wanted this product for me, but then I started to use it on my 2 year old daughter hair! It just smells so so amazing and it leaves both of our hair soft! Whenever one of us will use it I always towel dry both of our hair and then spray it in! I can’t get over the smell we love it!!!I’ve been on the hunt for a great all-natural detangler and THIS IS IS! I am in love. It smells like orange cream and works really well!I’ve beeb using the product for about 2 weeks. I was predominately looking for something to help with the tangles in my hair since it’s been randomly knotting up lately (26 years never had this problem). I use a de-tangling conditioner but wanted this for a quick daily spritz to make brushing the knots out less painful. It smells amazing and does help with the knots a bit but by not something I’d call a “game-changer”. That said, it does help a bit and leaves your hair smelling amazingMy daughter has long wavy hair and gets the worst knots and tangles and sometimes we are guilty of letting it get to bird nest status so when we muster up the courage to clear it up, we look for detangler sprays, this one caught our eye with the great reviews. We got our bottle and went to work with a wet brush but this was no miracle spray. I felt it didn’t do much of anything besides make her hair smell amazing and make the brushed out untangled sections super duper soft. I don’t hate it and I plan to use it on her after hair wash days but it kinda missed the “detangler” mark. Again, no miracle in a bottle but overall a pleasant spray.My 14 month old is a rough and tumble toddler who plays with her hair, rolls around on the carpet, sweats in her sleep, and runs her food crumb hands through her hair lol.This helps gently detangle, has a great and subtle scent that I smell all day (not artificial smelling or overpowering!) and a small spritz goes a long way. Highly recommend!I have long hair and the tangles were a problem. It works so well I am wondering what took me so long.The product off the bat smells really good, and it feels gentle against the hair. It helps to detangle my hair, yes, but the only reason why I rated it 4 instead of 5 is that I tried other hair detanglers that were more effective than this. Nonetheless, I like this product, and I see myself getting it from time to time, since it's gentle and smells delicious (lol).My daughter has Curley hair and it gets matted quite easily. She just turned 4 and has always let me do her hair without trouble but she is starting to get mad if it is too tangled. I love the honest companies shampoo and conditioner for her but I expected a better quality detangler from this company.Been using this detangler and really like it. Low rating due to spillage when I received it. Everything was soaked through but most of the product remained in the bottle. It was tightly wrapped in plastic so I’m guessing it was squished in the packaging. A box would have been better packaging then the soft envelope it came in.I started using this leave in detangler everyday on my little Pomeranian. I wanted something more natural without harsh or fake chemical smells. Works great, however smell does fade faster than expected.Smells super good but the smell doesn’t stay in your hair for too long. It leaves your hair looking nice but nothing crazy. Definitely get it though if you wanna try it out. Less knots which is good cuz I don’t brush my hair after showers, if you’re the same then I highly recommend.","[""Detangles knots & leaves hair more manageable"",""Made without parabens, dyes, synthetic fragrances, silicones, sulfates, formaldehyde donors"",""Gentle for baby; Softens & Detangles"",""Naturally Derived Ingredients; Includes Orange, Vanilla and Coconut Extract"",""Dermatologist-tested; Hypoallergenic""]"

"Powerbuilt 240093 8 Piece Zeon SAE Hex Bit Socket Set - with use for Damaged Fasteners, Standard, Rusted, Rounded Bolts,Size from 1/8"" to 3/8""",Powerbuilt,"ZEON SOCKET Powerbuilt Zeon sockets are designed to grip and turn damaged and rounded nuts and bolts. The patented design will grip and turn hex heads up to 85% rounded. And they work just as well on new nuts and bolts. The secret is the patented Zeon socket design - the more you turn them the harder they grab and hold damaged hex heads. Zeon sockets are heat-treated to hardness HRC 38-56 for maximum strength and durability.   ZEON HEX KEY and BIT SOCKET Powerbuilt Zeon hex bit sockets and hex key are designed to grip and turn damaged and rounded hex head fasteners. The patented design will grip and turn hex surfaces up to 85% rounded. And they work just as well on new fasteners. If you’ve got a hex head bolt or cap screw bolt that's too damaged to turn with a regular hex bit socket or hex key wrench that you can’t turn or a nut with rounded corners, use this tool. The secret is the patented Zeon bit socket design - the more you turn them the harder they grab and hold damaged hex heads. Zeon bit sockets are constructed of hardened S-2 Chromoly steel for maximum strength and durability.

Every Subaru dealership wanted about $160 to remove it. The 8mm standard allen had barely bit into the plug, and subsequent uses could only get it in 3 mm deep into the socket and it would just spin. Out of desperation, I tried this, because why not, and I'm very impressed by it. It took a couple initial tries to get the sockets to bite, but a couple good taps with a hammer and it bit down hard. So much so that the socket can out attached to the plug after it broke loose and I had to tap the bolt and socket with a hammer to get it apart. When I did get it apart, the socket still looked new, no damage at all. So this thing saved me at least $100+ and a lot of headache. And it's still ready for more. It's worth a try for anyone with a stuck bolt, but just make sure you give it a couple good tapes to let the socket bite into the medal and extract.

"Weruva Cats in the Kitchen, Chicken Frick 'A Zee with Chicken Au Jus Cat Food, 6oz Can (Pack of 24), Yellow",Weruva,"Meet Weruva, Makers of Cats in the Kitchen: Weruva was founded over ten year’s ago by David & Stacie Forman and is still proud be family owned and operated. WeRuVa was inspired by and named after the founder’s three rescued cats; Webster, Rudi and Vanessa. With the search for “The Best Cat Food Under the Sun” never seeming to end, David & Stacie thought, “Let’s give it a shot ourselves ” and gathered the best ingredients from around the world, formulated some fantastic recipes and created Weruva. Naturally, when they were lucky enough to have their rescued dog Baron enter the family, they decided to expand our products to include dog food. Our desire for more innovative, healthy pet products could not be stopped and we continued to dream up and produce some of the best products for pets and their people. Today, we have expanded our product offerings to include four cat wet food brands, two dog wet food brands, dry dog food, treats, pumpkin supplements and even litter! Quality Control, Safety & Ingredients: Weruva always strives to be more than just a pet food company. We are obsessive over Safety and Quality Control and only produce our products in BRC/USDA Approved Facilities; arguably the highest standards for human-food production. We also source responsible and sustainable raw materials. You will be happy to know Weruva uses Cage-Free Chickens, Grass-Fed Beef & Lamb, and Wild-Caught Fish. Did we mention everything is GMO-Free? Learn About Cats in the Kitchen Grain-Free Cat Cans & Pouches: The kitchen is so often the heart of the home. It is where our family gathers for meals, where we have our game night, where family bonds grow.We eat there, we laugh there—we feed our pets there. The inspiration for these delectable selections come from feeding our precious Cats in the Kitchen.

How is Cats in the Kitchen Different? CITK is a cross between Weruva and BFF pouches contain boneless, skinless white breast meat chicken, fish loins and a few formulas in pumpkin soup. The cans contain similar ingredients, but we’ve added in novel proteins like lamb and turkey, and included some dark meat chicken. The cans feature fish oil.

He licks the gravy but he also likes the real shredded chicken meat (the seafood flavors contain chunks of fish with the skin and bones and he eats that sh!t up too like there's no tomorrow).I've tried to give him other fancy (healthy) brands on special occasions like his birthday and he turns his nose up and walks away to starve to death (he's dramatic like that).Weruva isn't the cheapest brand and it recently went up in price at my local pet store, so ordering a case of this from Amazon is a more affordable option for my middle class lifestyle.The Chicken Frick a Zee flavor is a high-quality food if you're looking for something that's high in protein and low in phosphorus and carbs. The texture is a mix of coarse and fine shreds in gelee. I usually mix it with additional water to ensure that the kitties are well-hydrated. It's a good choice if your cats like poultry flavors.Other flavors also ticked the same boxes. The Isla Bonita flavor is lower in phosphorus, but also slightly lower in protein and higher in carbs. It's also not as calorie-dense as Frick A Zee however, so your kitty will need more. Weruva's Paw Lickin Chicken is in some ways superior, but it's more expensive. Frick A Zee is lower in protein and higher in fat by comparison, but this isn't necessarily bad.Lastly, if you're looking for something with no carbs at all, then check out Tiki Cat Koolina Luau. It's higher in protein, lower in phosphorus, and zero carb, but also more expensive than Weruva.Other pluses: Weruva as a company is transparent and informative on the nutritional content of their products. This also played a role in my purchasing decision.This is made of good ingredients-it’s highly rated for cats with urinary problems. It looks and smells like chicken. Not glop.My cat hates it.My cat LOVES Weruva Cats in the Kitchen Chicken Frick 'A Zee! I used to feed her a high-quality dry food. Although she's an indoor only cat, twice she got outside and stayed gone for days before returning -- once when she somehow got out during my husband's office party, and once when the pet sitter left the back door open for the dog (only to realize the next day that the cat had escaped! D'oh!!). The second time my cat ""escaped"" (perhaps she considered the open door not an opportunity to escape but an invitation from the pet sitter??? She never has told me exactly...), I made a promise that if she didn't become a tasty coyote snack, I would start feeding her wet food. She did come back, and so began our negotiations over which wet cat food to feed her began. I am pretty picky with the quality of the food that I feed her. She is pretty picky about taste (and her tastes have changed with wet foods over the past year). ANY vegetables in her cat food make her vomit. We happened upon Chicken Frick 'A Zee awhile back, and it is STILL one of her favorite cat foods! I love the quality (and lack of any grains or veggies in it), and she loves the shredded chicken and overall taste. I appreciate how fast I can get a case of the cans through Amazon Prime. What I appreciate even more is the freshness of the cans that I bought -- I purchased the case in April 2016, and the cans have a ""Best By"" date of November 2018! Can't beat that! Perhaps most importantly to me, bribing my cat with wet cat food daily seems to have stopped her need for any more ""walkabouts.""

The foot lands on outside of the heel, then rolls inward (pronates) to absorb shock and support body weight. The foot lands on outside of heel, then rolls inward (pronates) excessively, transferring weight to inner edge instead of ball of the foot.

I can throw them on and wear them comfortably from the first day without any break in period, and my feet and legs don't hurt even after 13-15 hour days on my feet. The GT-2000 7 lived up to this expectation. Comfortable, true to fit and support all day busy activity. I've received many compliments on their appearance. Overall, I am pleased. The only reason I have not given this shoe a 5 star rating is that as compared to other Asics Gel shoes I have had, the arch support area feels a little more flat and lacking. I have used Nimbus, Cloud and Kayano versions repeatedly before, and they have always had a really supportive heel cup and full arch support, leaving my feet feeling cupped or cradled for lack of a better description. Those versions gave fantastic full support through the foot. This version does not quite live up to that standard and feels much flatter under and through the foot. Still doing well through a month's use at work, straight out of the box. Time will tell if they last as long, or still feel as comfortable as long as my preferred versions.",null
